Quiz: If America Had Six Parties, Which Would You Belong To?
The Progressive Party

The Progressive Party is focused on equity and racial justice, with a strong vision of inclusive social democracy. Its strongest support comes from politically engaged, highly educated younger people, especially women.

Its potential leaders include Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren or Julián Castro. Based on data from the Democracy Fund’s VOTER survey, this party would be the best fit for about 14 percent of the electorate.
The New Liberal Party

The New Liberal Party is the professional-class establishment wing of the Democratic Party. Members are cosmopolitan in their social and racial views but more pro-business and more likely to see the wealthy as innovators.

Its potential leaders include Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Eric Garcetti and Beto O’Rourke. Based on data from the Democracy Fund’s VOTER survey, this party would be the best fit for about 26 percent of the electorate.
The American Labor Party

The American Labor Party is focused on economic populism, with an appeal to working-class Democrats who don’t have college degrees and don’t follow politics closely. It is more moderate on social and cultural issues compared with the Progressive Party, but also more diverse, appealing to many working-class Hispanics.

Its potential leaders include Sherrod Brown, Jon Tester and Tim Ryan. Based on data from the Democracy Fund’s VOTER survey, this party would be the best fit for about 12 percent of the electorate.
The Growth and Opportunity Party

The Growth and Opportunity Party is the socially moderate, pro-business wing of the Republican Party. It is the heir to the old moderate “Rockefeller Republican,” the East Coast wing of the G.O.P.

Its potential leaders include Larry Hogan, Charlie Baker, Mitt Romney, John Kasich and Michael Bloomberg. Based on data from the Democracy Fund’s VOTER survey, this party would be the best fit for about 14 percent of the electorate.
The Patriot Party

The Patriot Party is the party of Donald Trump’s 2016 primary campaign: the coalition of the small town, white working-class Americans who feel left behind by globalism and condescended to by cosmopolitanism. It is economically populist and strongly anti-immigration. Its strongest support among lower-income conservatives comes from exurban America.

Its potential leaders include Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton and Tucker Carlson. Based on data from the Democracy Fund’s VOTER survey, this party would be the best fit for about 14 percent of the electorate.
The Christian Conservative Party

The Christian Conservative Party is focused centrally on issues of religious liberty and morality, with very limited government. It will find stronger support among the most politically engaged and affluent, especially men.

Its potential leaders include Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott and Mike Pompeo. Based on data from the Democracy Fund’s VOTER survey, this party would be the best fit for about 20 percent of the electorate.

Each party represents a different portion of the electorate, not only ideologically but also by economic class and political engagement.

There is no “center” party here. That is because there are very few voters in the middle across all issues. Many readers who consider themselves centrist might also think of themselves as socially liberal/fiscally moderate or socially moderate/fiscally conservative. They will find a home in either the New Liberal Party or the Growth and Opportunity Party.

These six parties reflect the underlying factions — and divides — within the Democratic and Republican parties. Until American politics nationalized in the 1980s and 1990s around divisive culture-war issues, they operated more independently within the two major political parties.

We get to such a system through proportional multimember districts. This approach features districts much larger than our current tiny congressional ones — and each elects more than one person, at once, to represent the region. So more than one party could represent a district in proportion to their popularity within that large district — just as they do in most advanced democracies.

Legislation introduced in the current Congress, the Fair Representation Act, would require use of multimember districts with ranked-choice voting in most states’ House selections as well as elections for the Senate. If more parties emerged, coalitions across parties would form to elect a speaker and organize committee assignments — just as coalitions form in multiparty legislatures around the world. Multiparty democracy would facilitate the shifting alliances and bargaining that are essential in democracy but have largely disappeared in today’s zero-sum conflict.

The Senate would most likely become a much more free-wheeling institution, as it was in the past. Absent reform to the Electoral College, presidential elections would still probably come down to two major candidates. However, with partisan loyalties less fixed, more voters would judge candidates on the content of their ideas and character rather than the D or R next to their names. Moreover, a less hyperpartisan Congress will also most likely be less gridlocked and more productive, enabling it to reclaim a more central role in our national politics, lowering the stakes of presidential elections and potentially lowering the stakes for Supreme Court nominations in a new era of reduced partisanship.

It’s possible to see how the parties overlap by mapping survey results to our six-party mix.

Proportional multiparty democracies also have consistently higher turnout than majoritarian two-party democracies with single-winner districts.

No constitutional amendment is needed to enact this reform. Article I, Section IV of the Constitution gives Congress wide latitude to write congressional election rules. And in fact, multimember congressional districts were used commonly in the first half of the 19th century until Congress passed legislation banning them.

Freeing the existing factions to forge new and shifting alliances would liberate the political innovation lying untapped in our political system. Our current political system turns Americans against one another. Only by changing the rules and incentives of our politics can we give ourselves a fighting chance to respond to the tremendous challenges faced by our nation and planet.

The statement "multimember congressional districts were used commonly in the first half of the 19th century until Congress passed legislation banning them" is partially accurate but requires some clarification.

### Detailed Explanation and Fact Check:

1. **Usage of Multimember Districts**:
   - **Early 19th Century**: Multimember congressional districts, where more than one representative was elected from a single district, were indeed used in the early years of the United States. However, they were not as widespread as the term "commonly" might suggest. These districts were more prevalent in smaller or less populated states¹(https://thirty-thousand.org/blog/multimember-congressional-districts-in-the-early-republic/).
   - **General Ticket System**: Some states used a "general ticket" system where all representatives were elected at-large rather than from specific districts. This system allowed a dominant party to secure all seats in a state¹(https://thirty-thousand.org/blog/multimember-congressional-districts-in-the-early-republic/).

2. **Legislation Banning Multimember Districts**:
   - **Apportionment Act of 1842**: This act mandated that states use single-member districts for electing representatives to Congress. The goal was to ensure more equitable and representative elections²(https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/multi-member-legislative-districts-just-a-thing-of-the-past/).
   - **Uniform Congressional District Act of 1967**: This act reinforced the requirement for single-member districts, with very few exceptions³(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Congressional_District_Act).

### Summary:
While multimember districts were used in the early 19th century, their prevalence was limited, and they were more common in smaller states or those with fewer representatives. The Apportionment Act of 1842 marked the beginning of the end for multimember districts, mandating single-member districts to promote fairer representation.

### Key Points:
- **General Ticket System**: Some states used a general ticket system where all representatives were elected at-large rather than from specific districts. This system allowed a dominant party to secure all seats in a state¹(https://thirty-thousand.org/blog/multimember-congressional-districts-in-the-early-republic/).
