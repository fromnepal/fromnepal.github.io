FinanceYSK that when the US middle class was the wealthiest, the marginal tax rate on the rich ranged from 70 to 90% (self.YouShouldKnow)

submitted 2 hours ago by Buddha_Zone

Why YSK: Middle class people worry that increasing taxes on the rich will hurt their income, but the US conducted that experiment in the 20th century and the opposite is true.

https://taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates

There were still plenty of rich people, and a single union job could support an entire family. J Paul Getty had a tax rate of 70% in the 1970's and still was worth 6 billion dollars (23 billion in 2024 dollars).

Is that adjusted for both inflation and the obvious technology differences? It's pretty hard to make a direct comparison when you consider that technology changes the per capita contribution of each worker by several orders of magnitude.

i took it from Wikipedia, Wikipedia , and took number from "Scheidel/Friesen 2009" (I checked superficially, they are historian in antiquity). The study paper is from Cambridge , 31 pages and has been cited 92 times. If you want to read it, the pdf file is available for free without an account.

[–]JhonnyHopkins -2 points 20 minutes ago 

So they weren’t as big or as rich but I feel like they were still more influential/powerful compared to their neighbors of the time. In short I mean the Roman Empire was more of a “big deal” than the USA is considered today.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]JectorDelan 0 points 25 minutes ago 

I'm not responding about the respective GDP. I was asking about square miles and how the Roman empire was somehow larger back then at 60% of the current size of the US. Why are you trying to bring a part of your statement in that I wasn't asking about? Especially since it's already been covered by the other poster. Why did you not respond to his correction on the respective sizes? You get to ignore part of a conversation and it's fine, but others can't do the same with your posts?

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Shroomagnus 1 point just now 

What are you talking about dude? I asked about adjusting gdp for inflation and you responded to me specifically about square miles. It was plainly obvious I was asking about the gdp numbers just as it's obvious you can't adjust land size for inflation.

[–]SuperUltraBrokeDick 17 points an hour ago 

So say if we had another WW2 that left the world exactly like before, where the US is really the only large economy left fully functional. Would we see the middle class prosper and grow like it did back then with our current economy set up as it is? Or do you see it making the rich richer while further worsening the wealth inequality we have.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Bopas2 8 points 1 hour ago 

well we aren’t an industrial economy now like we were during ww2. seems hard to say

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]auiin 1 point 8 minutes ago 

We exported a lot of it to raise up other countries post WW2, starting with Japan, Germany, France and UK. Then India and Taiwan when the British gave them self government, South Korea after the peace, followed by Vietnam after the war, then moving to Yugoslavia after the Civil War there ended, and since it worked so well to prevent further conflicts we began spreading it to South America, although it was resisted in many countries for a long time, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil were highly protectionist. We attempted to do the same to Africa but only had success in some countries, as there were too many countries embroiled in sectarian Civil War. We shipped a lot to Mexico in the 90s to stabilize their economy. We are victims of our own success, this strategy worked well but there was never an agreed on plan to phase any of it back to the US after they stabilized and democratization was widely accepted. Victory has defeated us, economically speaking. It has ushered in the largest era of world peace ever seen in 400 years, which is undoubtedly a good thing, but it has taken a massive toll on generations of Americans.

[–]snack-attack23 2 points 51 minutes ago 

I might be wrong but my interpretation of this is that in today’s society one of the arguments for not increasing taxation on the rich is that they will move. Either taxing personal wealth would have billionaires change their citizenship to another nation or taxing corporations would make HQ’s move to a country with lower taxation.

Due to the damage (both physical and economical) the rich couldn’t really move their businesses or lives somewhere else and still be prosperous. But I guess then again it was probably much harder back then to move your entire life and company overseas in general.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]gimmedatrightMEOW 4 points 32 minutes ago 

US citizens who move still need to report, file, and pay taxes.

So fine. Move. But you need to pay your taxes or you can become a citizen of another country.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

Rich getting richer, that's it.

The government and tax rates aren't the same. Good faith has long gone out the window.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]PeteZappardi 1 point 45 minutes ago 

Honestly, it'd be both.

The result would be a whole bunch of new wealth flowing to the U.S. in the form of new business. That'll benefit the rich.

But if the U.S. population is the only workforce available to handle all this new business, then competition for employees will increase, which will transfer a subset of that new wealth to the middle class.

It's a situation where (from the perspective of the U.S.) the whole pie representing wealth gets bigger. Even if the ratio of "wealth controlled by the middle class" and "wealth controlled by the rich stays the same, everyone still has more pie at the end of the day. That ratio could even decrease a little bit and the middle class could still end up with more pie than they had before.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]VultureSausage 1 point 38 minutes ago 

With the caveat that having a larger share of the pie lets you decide how future pies are made and who gets those pieces of pie. Material wealth might not be a zero-sum game but the political power it brings is.

US production after both World Wars was massive. It's what turned us into a true superpower. We thrived from the ashes of other countries.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]CaveRanger 2 points an hour ago 

That is partly what was responsible for the post-war economic boom, but that does not negate that the massive investments in infrastructure and continued New Deal policies were having a big impact.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]HeeHawJew 2 points 39 minutes ago 

Yeah that might be because we didn’t fight on our soil and reduce a significant percentage of our infrastructure to rubble. The fact that we were the only world power with the capability to manufacture on a mass scale intact might have something to do with why American manufacturing became a major production source worldwide and why the economy boomed.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]VMCColorado 1 point an hour ago 

Can't ignore that almost no one paid that highest marginal tax rate because they kept the money invested in businesses rather than sucking it out to buy that third yacht.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Elkenrod 1 point 54 minutes ago 

We were the only superpower who wasn't completely decimated by the World Wars. The US lost next to nothing in comparison to the rest of the world, and we were able to capitalize on our position.

OP's graphic doesn't take that into account, and it also doesn't take into account how much more interconnected our economies are. The internet exists, globalization is a lot more common, we have faster and better trade routes, we're much less restricted on time and trade partners.

Even if we just look at the middle class; small business owners didn't need to compete with Amazon.com in 1918. They do today though, and Pandora's box can't just be closed. You needed a new hat? You went to the hatmaker and gave them business. You need a new hat today? You buy it off Amazon and have it delivered to you tomorrow.

Imagine how great the U.S. could be if the rich were taxed at least 50%. Taxes for poor could probably be lowered without any harm to the national deficit. The overall national deficit might be more manageable than where it’s at now. Schools and infrastructure could hsvr the funds they need to fix things or pay teachers appropriately. Healthcare could be better managed and supported for anyone that needs it…

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Stormlightlinux 52 points 2 hours ago 

Most is the luck of already having parents with wealth and connections.

Getting wealthy is like one of those carnival games with the rings and bottles.

Kids with wealthy parents get to throw as many times as they need to. If they care to keep throwing, eventually they will have a success.

The middle class kids get one or two shots. With a high enough combination of luck and skill, they'll get a win too.

The poor kids work the carnival.

It doesn't say at which income the marginal tax rate applies. Another important point not mentioned is what they treated as "income". Most billionaires didn't become billionaires because of their salary as employees.

From 1932 to the early 60’s the marginal tax rate was highly effective. At its peak the 94% tax rate applied to every dollar above 200K, around 3M in today’s dollars.

Pre-Reagan the effective tax rate on the ultra wealthy was 42.9% with a top marginal rate of 70%. Post Reagan the top marginal rate was 50% with an effective rate of 32% for the ultra wealthy.

To be fair, the reason it worked is because in the wake of WWII, there were no major economies left intact basically worldwide.

The US was the beneficiary of a very specific set of circumstances that let this work temporarily. We also got rid of that tax rate pretty quickly after introducing it.

Taxes that high are unlikely to work again in present circumstances, and there isn’t really a serious argument that spiking taxes on the middle class to 70% or 90% would have tangible benefits for anyone but the ultra wealthy.

This is going to be an unpopular thing to say. But basically noone actually paid that rate, there were so many loopholes that were added to the tax code that anyone wealthy didn't pay it. So yes technically, the economy still thrived under those taxes but the effective taxes were much lower.

And no one ever points out nearly no one paid anywhere near that amount. It was a tax rate for show as most of the ultra wealthy found ways around it.

So 70-90 is just bullshit. And the issue is NOT wealthy individuals not paying taxes, most individuals actually pay a shit ton. It's giant corporations making BILLIONS in profit akd ending their years with Zero Tax liability.

Focus on making sure individual rich people pay what's required now and that ALL corporations pay their required share. End loopholes, deductions, akd write offs above a certain income. And tax fucking churches.

Yeah stupid question sry lol

It is interesting that income tax was essentially wildly spiked up to pay for war, but never really came back down and is now used to fund everything else.

Such a great comment. Asking questions just means that you’re on your way to becoming a critical thinker and you require more information.

Anyone that makes folks feel bad for asking questions are detrimental to humanity and its progression.

It’s always the middle class against higher taxes for billionaires. As if they have a chance at a billion dollars.

    a single union job could support an entire family

This was when the US still enjoyed post WWII industrial dominance as Europe rebuilt and Asia was still industrializing and bringing itself out of abject poverty. That world was miserable for a very large percentage of the global population and the US benefited tremendously. Once Asia caught up our inefficient, bloated industries that could afford to pay high salaries to low-skilled union workers were wiped out, as you would expect. The union workers’ loss was to the benefit of hundreds of millions of Asian workers who began to experience living in a middle income country.

This is absurd. You mean the same 70’s when during the Carter administration the interest rates were over 16%? The stock market didn’t take off until taxes were lowered which caused the economy to grow as a whole. This is skewed cherry-picked bias nonsense.

Correlation does not equal causation. No, that’s not me saying it ISNT causation but to extrapolate that without any other data is woeful.

YSK that the effective tax rate for the extremely rich has only dropped by a few points since the 50’s.

Marginal tax rate needs to go up higher.

Also they need to figure out how to tax loans against vast wealth, because that's the method the suoer rich use. I'd like to see the ideas on that.

Here’s a tidbit of info for you all to understand a current experiment.

A friend of mine has a landlord who has never raised the rent. His rental house costs him 1,300 a month in Seattle (proper Seattle!).

He lived there for four years and now with modern Seattle income for non-tech he will be able to buy a $800K house from the savings he made.

The landlord never maintains the place but will discount the difference in rent for a given month if the tenant does any repairs/replacements.
Housing prices alone are destroying the middle class, all it takes is affordable housing to start being able to afford life. Better paying jobs and taxing the rich would make it so we can have families again.

If they increase it for the wealthy, does that mean they reduce it for middle and lower class? Cause the government isn't usually the best with "extra" money.
