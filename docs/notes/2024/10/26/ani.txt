    Civil defamation

Asian News International vs. Wikimedia Foundation (CS(OS) 524/2024) is an ongoing civil defamation case in India.
ANI Media Private Limited, the parent company of news agency Asian News International (ANI), filed a ₹2 crore (approximately US$240,000) defamation suit against the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), over the description of ANI in the English Wikipedia article about the news agency.
The judge in the case has threatened to order the government of India to shut down Wikipedia in India. Nishant Shah, professor of Global Media at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and faculty associate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, and journalist Nikhil Phawa characterized the judge's order to WMF to release the identities of the editors who made the edits as censorship and a threat to the flow of information.[2][3]
Background​[edit]
WMF is the non-profit organization that supports Wikipedia, in multiple languages, and multiple other similar projects.[4] Each project is independent and largely self-governed; the Wikimedia Foundation exerts limited authority over any project, typically not becoming involved with content policy.[5][6]
Wikipedia is created and maintained completely by volunteer "editors", its term for anyone who makes as much a single typo correction on an article. Hundreds of thousands of such editors exist worldwide, and most can make changes to most articles on the website. A smaller number of editors make enough edits that they are allowed to edit nearly any article.[4] Editors are anonymous, except those who voluntarily disclose their identities.[6]
Wikipedia articles generally are protected if the article is experiencing a high level of vandalism or an edit-war, a series of back-and-forth reversions between two or more versions by two or more editors. Sometimes articles are protected because edits are being made by multiple editors with a conflict of interest, such as employees of an organization that is the subject of an article.[6] In 2020 the article about news agency Asian News International was edited to include content from new sources discussing the agency's record, and an edit war ensued — involving new editors making the same changes to remove the new additions — and the article was eventually protected.[7][6]
Court case​[edit]
At the time of the suit's filing, the Wikipedia article about ANI said the news agency had "been accused of having served as a propaganda tool for the incumbent central government, distributing materials from a vast network of fake news websites, and misreporting events on multiple occasions".[8][9][10][11] The filing accused Wikipedia of publishing "false and defamatory content with the malicious intent of tarnishing the news agency's reputation, and aimed to discredit its goodwill".[6]
The filing argued that Wikipedia "is a platform used as public utility and as such cannot behave as a private sector".[5][12][3] It also complained that Wikipedia had "closed" the article about ANI for editing except by Wikipedia's "own editors", citing this as evidence of defamation with malicious intent and evidence that WMF was using its "officials" to "actively participate" in controlling content.[5][12][11][13][14] ANI asked for ₹2 crore (approximately US$240,000) in damages and an injunction against Wikipedia "making, publishing, or circulating allegedly false, misleading, and defamatory content against ANI".[12][6]
The case was filed in July 2024 before Justice Navin Chawla in the Delhi High Court as ANI Media Pvt. Ltd. v Wikimedia Foundation Inc & Ors.[12][5][3][11][10] ANI argued that Wikipedia is a significant social media "intermediary" within the definition of Information Technology Act, 2000, and must therefore comply with the requirements of the Act, including taking down any content that the government or its agencies deem violative, or be personally liable for content published under its platform.[10] Chawla issued a summons to WMF, called the lawsuit "a pure case of defamation" and set a hearing date of 20 August.[15][14] On 20 August 2024, Chawla ordered WMF to disclose identifying details of three editors (also defendants in the lawsuit) who had worked on the Wikipedia article about ANI to allow ANI to pursue legal action against them as individuals.[8][2][16] Chawla ordered WMF to provide the information within two weeks.[8]
On 5 September, ANI asked the court to find WMF in contempt when the identifying details were not released within the time frame.[8][6] Chawla issued a contempt of court order and threatened to order the government of India to block Wikipedia in the country, saying “We will not take it any more. If you don’t like India, please don’t work in India...We will close your business transactions here."[17][18][7][19] In response, Wikimedia emphasized that the information in the article was supported by multiple reliable secondary sources.[8] Chawla ordered that an "authorised representative" of WMF appear in person at the next hearing, which was scheduled for 25 October 2024.[8][16]
On 14 October, Delhi High Court justices Manmohan and Tushar Rao Gedela objected to the creation of an English Wikipedia article about the defamation case, saying the article "disclos[ed] something about a sub-judice matter" and "will have to be taken down", and scheduled review for 16 October.[20][21][22] On 16 October, the court stated that "Accordingly, in the interim, this Court directs that the pages on Wikipedia pertaining to the single judge as well as discussion of the observations of division bench be taken down or deleted within 36 hours".[23][24]
Analysis​[edit]
According to Newslaundry, the sentence ANI objects to has "clear citations that lead to the primary source of information", including to The Caravan, The Ken, BBC News, EU DisinfoLab, Politico, and The Diplomat. Newslaundry and journalist Nikhil Pahwa pointed out that none of the media organizations used as sources were included in ANI's complaint.[6][3] According to The Indian Express, the lawsuit is an attempt to hold WMF liable for edits to Wikipedia.[10]
Reaction​[edit]
Nishant Shah, professor of Global Media at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and faculty associate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, wrote that Chawla's decision to order the release of personally-identifying information was "a challenge to freedom of speech and information" and would result in the censorship of "any form of critical information that powerful organisations do not like".[2] Pahwa called it censorship that threatened to "stifle the flow of information and knowledge".[3] The Wikimedia Foundation commented on the case, stating that decisions on what to add to or change in an article are performed "by its global community of volunteer editors”, and that the foundation “does not add, edit or determine content”.[25][9]

This case involves a defamation lawsuit filed by Asian News International (ANI) against the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), which supports Wikipedia. ANI claims that the Wikipedia article about them contains defamatory content, accusing them of being a propaganda tool and spreading fake news. ANI is seeking ₹2 crore (approximately US$240,000) in damages and an injunction to prevent Wikipedia from publishing similar content.

The Delhi High Court has ordered WMF to disclose the identities of the editors who made the edits, which WMF has not complied with, leading to threats of blocking Wikipedia in India. The Wikimedia Foundation is defending the content, stating it is based on reliable sources and emphasizing the role of volunteer editors in creating Wikipedia content. The case is ongoing, with significant implications for freedom of speech and information in India.

There are a lot of lessons to learn here

1. The Streisand effect. No-one on HN gave a monkeys about this dodgy news agency till today. Now half of us have read the archive about how they promote propaganda & fake news. Your reputation takes a hit

2. There is no absolute definition of “freedom”. Wikipedia is a fantastic resource for humanity in general and I think should be defended. But as more and more of humanity come to live more and more online, then the legal and cultural norms will shift and shuffle - courts for two hundred years have assumed they can order anyone in their jurisdiction around and often not in their jurisdiction- and that’s kind of the point of courts. So what is freedom? It’s what we the demos and the courts agree …

3. An example is in the order (I mean on the Streisand effect - when the %#}#% hell would I ever read a court order from India ?!) - it says “herein to take down/delete” - this bespeaks a failure to understand the world on the level of “who are the Beatles”. Take down - fine this is part of how we agree norms and limits of courts. Delete. Are you kidding me. Does that imply from everywhere else? Wow.

Wikipedia looks like a fantastic resource, but it's not really a reliable source of information. Everyone can write things there, including people with biases and conflicting interests. Their rules about editing are really annoying and unfair, they don't care about facts.

I enjoy reading Wikipedia sometimes, but it's a broken system, a lot of truths missing in it's articles because of crap editors and political propaganda. Also it's admins are toxic and abuse their little power they have over every editor there.

Try editing some articles there, and you will see the dark side of Wikipedia.

It's about as reliable it gets. It cites sources, has whole history available, has little conflicts of interest and has transparent editorial guidelines and process.

Many people are probably shocked to find views in WP that aren't aligned with what their newsmedia reports and frames.

Wikipedia is often wrong once you stray from mainstream topics. Subspecialties often have 1-2 super-contributors, whose blind spots and misunderstandings become part of Wikipedia. Plenty of articles also have no actual citations of their technical content.

This is usually a no drama environment sure I have helped delete articles that later became notable and removed true facts lacking sources. Many of these things have fixed themselves over time.

I edit a bit and it seems mostly accurate but I've followed covid origins for a while and the bit "While other explanations, such as speculations that SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally released from a laboratory have been proposed, such explanations are not supported by evidence." isn't really true. There is evidence but for some reason they only want to cite papers from the scientific establishment saying the scientific establishment is innocent.

On January 18 2012, Wikipedia went black to draw attention to SOPA [0], a bill they described as one that "could fatally damage the free and open Internet".

Since then, we've seen a slow and steady march in the direction we all dreaded. Country after country has decided that they have the right to block content on the "free and open Internet", and business after business (even those who joined the SOPA protests) has complied. Someone looking ahead from 2012 would barely recognize the internet today as being the same thing, the way we just roll over to the threats that used to cause global outrage and defiance.

Were we naive even at the time? Have governments become more authoritarian? Or has our energy for resistance just been slowly whittled away?

As more normies got on the web more of it becomes about how to herd them.

In the early days there was less gain from authoritarian actions, because you are more likely to be resisted by the users of any service.

The current users don't know how to bypass restrictions, and are generally more numerous. Making authoritarian actions more valuable.

Unfortunately this leads to previously useful sites declining.

If you go to your government’s office and they give you a list of names of known advertisers, then walk along your merry way and use the list to not engage those advertisers, the only trust you need is the source of the information on that list, not the list or your observance to it.

Your observance of it is open source in the case of ublock. The list should still be scrutinized, it’s a local system with an unverified source. That’s all.

"With software, either the users control the program, or the program controls the users."

- Richard M. Stallman, 2011, writing in Der Spiegel

He was right. He was always right. About all of it. People didn't listen, or perhaps were never introduced to his ideas. Software grew faster than the idea of free software (on some level this was inevitable, since the latter is by definition a subset of the former).

And so, the noose tightened a little more every year.

The remedy has never changed: you must explain to people why freedom is important, and what the terrible consequences are of non-freedom. Refer them to the free software ecosystem, Linux and the FSF. Many will not listen. But whether they listen is to some extent irrelevant. Life is more fulfilling when it is lived ethically. By doing your part to advocate for freedom and against its enemies, you are at least making your own welfare better, and hopefully someone else's too.

> Linux has joined the dark side too. Banning people based on nationality

"Linux" is not banning anybody. They must comply with the sanctions against Putin regime that many governments in the world raised, in response to insane Putin's behavior.

Linux is not banning people based on nationality, is banning people based on their employers that is a different question. Linux has every right to ban somebody that would be working for a cartel, for example. This is a win-win for the people banned also, because protects them to be targeted and forced by the Russian regime to participate on war crimes.

Calling about "mafreedom!" and "your lack of ethics" just looks deranged and out of the reality. "mafreedom to kill you (and you must help me to build the bombs or are a very bad guy)" is preschool level material. Not even funny as a joke. They really think that we are so stupid?

> Linux lacks ethics

Since 2022 the Russian president is sending 1000 Russians a day to a sure death, could stop the carnage at any time, and couldn't care less about it. Most Russians support him and don't care also. I will not accept any lesson on ethics.

Nonsense.

If your concern is that a maintainer might be strongarmed into getting surreptitious changes in the linux kernel, that's a misplaced concern because:

1- the maintainer in question didn't have access to approve changes across the whole linux kernel, but only on the drivers that they were maintaining (mainly Baikal electronics hardware, I assume. I.e. the Russian government could sabotage the drivers for hardware developed inside Russia itself, not exactly something that we'd truly have to worry about)

2- just because an individual, working in the open and with a clear/known identity (and association with a bankrupt Russian hardware design firm) has been excluded, it doesn't mean that a government might give up trying to sneak in changes. They can just create new personas (just like with "Jia Tan" of xz fame)

I understand that the Linux kernel got their hand forced, but this is just stopping a volunteer from contributing (and feeling welcome), in an open source project in which they had been involved for several years. It's a win for the Linux kernel (because they are not going to get a slap on their wrists), but it's not a win for the affected individuals

To elaborate, if you're genuinely thinking that:

1- the affected maintainer has any concern of potentially being strongarmed

2- the affected maintainer appreciates being excluded from a project in which they worked on for several years

I'm not arguing for/against the exclusions due to sanctions. I think the benefit of banning people who used to work for a banned entity is minimal, but after all, if they are still using an email address provided by that sanctioned entity (alumni access?) of course they haven't disentangled themselves fully from that entity

This is obviously unfortunate but I think the issue is a lot bigger than Linux. It should serve as a reminder that there are no liberals in war.

The civil liberties you take for granted, in a major war, they will be gone. They will die in one day and it will take decades to get them back if ever. Remember that in WW2 America was throwing Japanese citizens into internment camps and the other side was doing far worse. Things that are unfathomable today but in a war with sufficiently high stakes they will happen again and more.

Even at war, the USA was still much more "liberal" than Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan: for starters, they didn't put any German citizens / German descendants in a concentration camp.

The Japanese descendants/citizens living in the USA were treated different because of racism. You can argue that having a racist government isn't compatible with being "liberal", but it's a matter of degree.

It can go the other way, too. I’m a computer programmer and I don’t use an ad-blocker, one of the reasons being that the presence of add is a very good indicator of websites that I should avoid. That strategy makes me actuality consume less content on the web, which I find as a big plus, and that’s because the great majority of today’s websites are filled with ads.

Related, the same goes for TV, where I don’t try to avoid them by purchasing an even more exclusive access to TV content (such as streaming), I just choose not to watch it because mainstream TV has become infested by ads. So the idea is not to play the game, just to ignore it.

In case you watch on an Android phone: Newpipe doesn't even use your account, so the possibility of getting banned for it is much smaller.

You can make playlists in it and track your history (locally), so I don't think it's inferior to the official app. On the contrary.

Also, these new Android phones have the option to modify which app opens youtube links by default, so it's easy to just list Newpipe instead of the official app.

The only downside are downtimes a few times per year when YT changes something and Newpipe devs are making a fix, which never took more than a few days.

    According to Washington Post, 150,000 social media workers spread posts aimed at exploiting the fears of India’s Hindu majority across a vast network of WhatsApp groups.

    BJP orchestrates online campaigns through its social media cell to intimidate perceived government critics. Sadhavi Khosla, a BJP cyber-volunteer in the BJP IT Cell said that the organisation disseminated misogyny, Islamophobia and hatred.

Again, my comment was not about the exodus but regarding the politics regarding the last 500 years and more specifically the last 70-90 odd years of history. That has nothing minority-majority issue you are claiming it out to be.

Let us put this way. There were a particular group in a region which comprised around 5% of the population. In a year or two, it dropped to effectively 0%. Now the exact terminology to use for this can be taken as genocide or ethnic cleansing or the somewhat passive "mass exodus".

Regarding the edits, I wont attempt to assume that the other side are right. But there is a sensitivity around the politics and history there, with the backdrop of the secessionist movement and the genocide/ethnic cleansing. So can see possibility of differing views there, with conflicting narratives being pushed.

> On the topic of exodus, you know it was the governor who ordered that the minority to be removed from their homes ? I know because I was there. You might not.

Really! A whole population just packed their bags and left their livelihoods, homes and properties to go and live in refugee camps, just because a governor asked them to. And not because gun toting terrorists supported by the local population where roaming around targeting them for rape and murder ? I will take the words of the people who had to flee, rather than those who were complicit in the genocide/ethnic cleansing.

If you want to split the categories between normies and neckbeards that's good enough a model of the world to understand the issue.

The part that I miss is we had things in public, collaborations between everyone who was interested in spending the time to access the space. This barrier was enough to keep things feeling like a community, with most of the things like this that came up being able to be addressed by internal arguments.

Now everything has to be robust to the idea that you will have neckbeards and normies interacting, and that curation is required. You have passive users, who's eyes are valuable... contributors, with divergent motivation, some pure for the joy of the project, some who want to put their agenda in front of the first group...

The wider Anglosphere is pushing this too. One organization behind it in both the UK and the US is the UK Labour Party. Yes, you read that correctly - high level Labour party operatives formed a nonprofit in the US to lobby for misinformation legislation, to ban X, and to pressure various other websites into deleting content.

> CCDH also held meetings with federal legislators while pushing for “change in USA” toward a censorious proposal it calls the “STAR framework,” which would create an “independent digital regulator” that could “impose consequences for harmful content.” STAR’s core concepts are similar to Europe’s just-instituted Digital Services Act and Britain’s even more stringent Online Safety Act, which puts the national media regulator Ofcom in charge of determining fines for uncooperative platforms.

I mean it's a pretty fundamental tenet of liberty that you have the freedom to do things only to the extent that you don't harm others.

And it's a simple consequence of scaling that the more massively you scale a communication system like the internet the more pathways there are for person A to harm person B.

So naturally there end up being more cases evaluating harm that involve the internet. Some of those cases will involve ordinary judicial things like injunctions.

And all of that is true regardless of whether you believe any one particular injunction is justified or unjustified. It's just a matter of what happens at scale.

You can, of course, try to give up the notion that liberty ends when you start causing harm, and many people have gone down that path. But for those of us who are still in the liberty camp, these questions are difficult and involve weighing a number of concerns and claims. And anyone who thinks they have easy answers is probably just deeply confused or high on rhetoric.

Yes, of course there are good reasons for this: without paying, the artists don't get paid and that means making music becomes no more than an expensive hobby and yadda yadda but that's my point: we may have corporeal justifications for the scarcity we impose on the Internet but the scarcity exists and we deliberately created it and use the police and military to enforce it.

As an Indian, you cannot understand the despair this makes me feel. ANI is a bit like privatised Pravda operating in service to the government, yet, still pretending to be independent journalism. Wherever there is a critic of the government, ANI exists to slander such critics as a service.

As a discerning reader, you learn to avoid mainstream media that quotes ANI (don't even consider watching a TV channel). You seek out alternate information sources. As the entity aligns closer with the ruling party and the mega-corporations like Adani that are aligned with it, you basically witness an octopus take over all information communication in India.

Then you get harsher and harsher laws regulating social media. You get no new laws protecting your speech. You witness a general fatalism set in on the few Indian comment sections that still think this stuff is wrong. But one day you see it on HN and realise everyone is basically powerless here.

Foolish maybe, but I genuinely hoped the open and open-sourced side of the internet would transcend borders. There must exist an information ecosystem that is above government. But Linux bans Russian devs, wikipedia is blocked worldwide because they wouldn't reveal an editor's biodata to India, social media platforms regulating information appoint information officers to enforce dictatorial government orders.

Where is the technology that can challenge this? At what point can the principle of "code is law" support free human expression instead of serving the whims of the latest oppressive regime?

I would implore any devs making open-source censorship-proof tools to consider the Indian context as ground zero.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International covers the lawsuit as well.

"In July 2024, ANI filed a lawsuit against Wikimedia Foundation in the Delhi High Court — claiming to have been defamed in its article on Wikipedia — and sought ₹2 crore (US$240,000) in damages.[16][17][18] On 5 September, the Court threatened to hold Wikimedia guilty of contempt for failing to disclose information about the editors who had made changes to the article and warned that Wikipedia might be blocked in India upon further non-compliance. The judge on the case stated "If you don't like India, please don't work in India... We will ask government to block your site".[19][20] In response, Wikimedia emphasized that the information in the article was supported by multiple reliable secondary sources.[21] Justice Manmohan said "I think nothing can be worse for a news agency than to be called a puppet of an intelligence agency, stooge of the government. If that is true, the credibility goes."[22]"

I suppose that this might not be the most objective article on Wikipedia. I don't have context for these statements. The way that Wikipedia quotes the judge makes it sound like he's threatening to order the Indian government to block Wikipedia because Wikipedia says that ANI is government propaganda. Is that really what's going on? If so it seems extremely ironic, to the point of tacitly admitting ANI's links to the Indian government. I know hacker news has many Indian readers; can they provide some context or an alternative perspective?

No. You read the statements right. Indian judges tend to give such statements, sometimes even worse. For example, recently one judge in unrelated case gave a statement that “criminalising marital rape is bit harsh”.

The main problem in this case is that Wikimedia hasn’t complied YET with high court orders of revealing people who did the edits. ANI just went ahead and filed contempt of court case before Wiki legal team could respond. I’m not sure if initial order came with some sort of deadline or not. I guess they are trying to leverage the delay in their favour.

In my opinion, ANI and many media houses in India are partially controlled by incumbent party ( BJP ) either by incentives or manipulation, you can read about Income tax raid on BBC and some other media outlets for understanding their methods.

Some illustrative examples:

- Judge Mahesh Sharma told TV channels that "the peahen gets pregnant" only by "swallowing the tears of the peacock".

- The Delhi High Court granted anticipatory bail to a rape accused government accused after the survivor’s mother expressed that she has no objection to the same.

- In a bizarre order, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court granted bail to a man accused of raping and impregnating a 17-year-old girl under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on a condition that he marries he after she attains the majority age of 18.(Tamil Nadu)

- Granting pre arrest bail to a rape accused, Karnataka High Court took sexual violence jurisprudence back by decades.The court speculated why the complainant did not approach the court earlier when the accused was allegedly asking her for sexual favours. The court also questioned why the complainant went to her office late night and did not object to consumption of alcohol. The court said that the complainant’s explanation that she fell asleep after the alleged crime is “unbecoming of a woman; that is not the way our women react when they are ravished”.

Just memorizing law to a great extent doesn't elevate judges above societal prejudices and backwardness.

I’d like to clear up some misconceptions about jurisdiction going on in this thread, purely from the perspective of international law.

As a matter of sovereignty, a state can exercise judicial jurisdiction over its territory, over its nationals, over national security concerns and over the most grave crimes.

A state’s jurisdiction can apply even to foreign people/companies who have no presence in said state at all. What the state’s courts can’t do is enforce their decisions abroad.

I know nothing about Indian law, but I know it has the right to set its own judicial jurisdiction. Accordingly, it can surely grant courts the power to order worldwide content bans. The real questions at stake in this case are:

1) does Wikipedia have any presence in India, so that Indian courts can compel it to follow their orders?

2) which countries where Wikipedia operates are able to receive requests from Indian courts and take enforcement action based on them?

It might not be fair, or right, but that’s the way it is. Thankfully, the obstacles to enforcing absurd orders abroad are usually high enough that they discourage said orders, or render them ineffective.

In this case India trying to enforce a worldwide ban on this story is clearly unenforceable. And because of VPNs that means that enforcing a national ban on this story is clearly unfeasible. However, because the people who make the laws are ignorant of the technical reasons why it's unfeasible they'll carry on and do it anyway.

I wouldn’t say this specific order is “clearly unenforceable” — after all, Wikipedia did remove what it was asked to remove globally, at least for now, didn’t it?

Yes, people can use VPNs to circumvent the order if the banned content is available elsewhere. But the law and judicial orders do more than just attempt to constrain behaviors.

Legally, those within the reach of India’s enforcement jurisdiction can be punished for disobeying the order. And since we’re all discussing things from a practical standpoint as well, we should keep in mind that states often uphold their interests abroad — even illegally. See the recent diplomatic row involving India and Canada, for instance.

I insist: both in legal and in practical terms, there is more to this case.

I am following this case closely to see how will WMF handle the issue when it goes to court, as the issue I am experiencing is similar to this one.

To describe briefly: There is a politician ("S") with articles in various languages of Wikipedia. One day, a group of people claiming to be the daughter of S ("T") tried to insert content that can be described as "trivial" and not relating to the work of S itself. Wikipedia editors, including myself, tried to argue to T that the content T inserted in an article about S isn't something that should be inserted, and despite the article of S including the criticism relating to lawsuit against S and his policy, the content was supported by books written by scholars. T simply argued that the content written in article of S is false, and threatened to bring lawsuit against editors involving in the process of keeping article of S up to standard. So far, T managed to file a police report against some editors, but no lawsuits were filed as far as I know. T also maintained presence in another forum, and I also argue that Wikipedia do not allow T to insert content of S in a manner T intended to. Instead, T decided to quote my reply out of context to defame me, causing me to send cease and desist notice. This prompted T to stalk my lawyer and publish the information, causing the lawyer and myself to discuss further action that should be taken in relation to this issue.

I have reported this incident to WMF 5 years ago, as the issue has been as long as that point. The issue on T and S has become so persistent such that I have proposed that our language of WMF project will ban any content relating to their family, as we do not want our volunteers to expose to legal liability for having to deal with frivolous lawsuit. This threatened lawsuit is one of the reasons I largely retired from writing content in Wikipedia, as I do not want accomplices of T and S to discover that I am active and that they will continue to harass me, though I'll still handle this behind the scenes if needed.

I don't think pushing further to make the law impossible to enforce on the internet is the right direction. The right direction is to step up and work to make good rules. And maybe that means sites like wikipedia or google don't function in countries where the government has values incompatible with liberal democracy. That's fine.

Some context that is essentially personal opinion, take it for what it's worth:

It's not that ANI is an absolutely non-partisan and an objective outlet. They do lean pro-government, but the yardstick being applied here is not consistent at all. No Indian news outlet is great by that yardstick, but one is being called an absolute sham, and those who consistently take anti-establishment stances, often without merit, barely get a footnote.

Now you could argue that Wikipedia is volunteer-driven, and you could submit an edit, but it is hard. During the farmers' protests ~3 years ago, articles were worded in a manner that led one to believe that deaths by natural causes among the protestors were somehow caused by the protests. I just checked the article as I was writing this response, and there is still a detailed section titled "fatalities" that mostly documents deaths from natural causes. I tried sending in edits for some of this back in the day but faced an uphill battle against other contributors and gave up because I had a day job to get to.

None of this justifies a page being blocked, especially outside Indian jurisdiction, but it would be unwise to ignore the broader context about the website being an ideological battleground and not being able to pull off the right balance.

isn't that the job of news media?

if they are doing it consistently - good on them.

Thanks, this article quoted in that discussion provides helpful background (written about a different case but might apply):

https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2020/05/16/a-sullivan-fo...

"Quashing in a criminal defamation case is a difficult prospect. This is because – to simplify – under Section 499 of the IPC, a prima facie offence of defamation is made out with the existence of a defamatory imputation, which has been made with the intention or knowledge that it will cause harm. This is, evidently, a very low threshold. Section 499 also contains a set of exceptions to the rule (such as statements that are true and in the public interest, statements made in good faith about public questions, and so on) – but here’s the rub: these exceptions only kick in at the stage of trial, by which time the legal process has (in all likelihood) dragged on for years. What we essentially have, therefore, is one of those situations where the cost of censorship is low (instituting prima facie credible criminal proceedings), but the cost of speech is high (a tedious, time-consuming, and expensive trial, with the possibility of imprisonment). Long-standing readers will recall that this structure of criminal defamation law – and the chilling effect that it causes – was part of the unsuccessful 2016 challenge to the constitutionality of Section 499."

This was enlightening. Thanks for posting the link because I never would have found this page.

Notably, Jimmy Wales also posted a statement on that page. The tl;dr seems to be they are intent on exhausting all legal options in India, but non-compliance in the short term is not an option if they wish to retain the right to appeal in India’s court system. I don’t know anything about India’s courts myself, but I copied his statement below:

> Comment from Jimbo Wales

> Hi everyone, I spoke to the team at the WMF yesterday afternoon in a quick meeting of the board. Although I've been around Internet legal issues for a long time, it's important to note that I am not a lawyer and that I am not here speaking for the WMF nor the board as a whole. I'm speaking personally as a Wikipedian. As you might expect, it's pretty limited as to what people are able to say at this point, and unwise to give too many details. However, I can tell you that I went into the call initially very skeptical of the idea of even temporarily taking down this page and I was persuaded very quickly by a single fact that changed my mind: if we did not comply with this order, we would lose the possibility to appeal and the consequences would be dire in terms of achieving our ultimate goals here. For those who are concerned that this is somehow the WMF giving in on the principles that we all hold so dear, don't worry. I heard from the WMF quite strong moral and legal support for doing the right thing here - and that includes going through the process in the right way. Prior to the call, I thought that the consequence would just be a block of Wikipedia by the Indian government. While that's never a good thing, it's always been something we're prepared to accept in order to stand for freedom of expression. We were blocked in Turkey for 3 years or so, and fought all the way to the Supreme Court and won. Nothing has chnaged about our principles. The difference in this case is that the short term legal requirements in order to not wreck the long term chance of victory made this a necessary step. My understanding is that the WMF has consulted with fellow traveler human rights and freedom of expression groups who have supported that we should do everything we can to win this battle for the long run, as opposed to petulantly refusing to do something today. I hope these words are reassuring to those who may have had some concerns!--Jimbo Wales (talk) 09:13, 21 October 2024 (UTC)

We desperately need more work done on a separate internet that by design cannot and never can be censored.

I know there are some projects toward that already, but my fear is they won't reach maturity before governments blocking any content they don't want their population accessing is the norm.

Some things should be illegal, sure, but if governments start attacking free speech and limiting what materials a population should have access to when they have no reason to do so, then an alternate network where crime is rampant that they can't police is a necessary price to pay to get around unjust authoritarianism.

This fundamentally doesn't work because internet is not something existing in a vacuum - you need wires, fibers and servers to make it work, and those are located in somebodies jurisdiction.

The willingness to transmit encrypted data exists for now in most countries, but would some kind of fully encrypted ungovernable internet take hold, that may rapidly change.

As with DeFi, some problems cannot be solved by technology, they must be solved in courts, parliaments and in elections - at least where it's possible to do so.

From the removed article:

At the time of the suit's filing, the Wikipedia article about ANI said the news agency had "been accused of having served as a propaganda tool for the incumbent central government, distributing materials from a vast network of fake news websites, and misreporting events on multiple occasions". The filing accused Wikipedia of publishing "false and defamatory content with the malicious intent of tarnishing the news agency's reputation, and aimed to discredit its goodwill".

The filing argued that Wikipedia "is a platform used as public utility and as such cannot behave as a private sector". It also complained that Wikipedia had "closed" the article about ANI for editing except by Wikipedia's "own editors", citing this as evidence of defamation with malicious intent and evidence that WMF was using its "officials" to "actively participate" in controlling content. ANI asked for ₹2 crore (approximately US$240,000) in damages and an injunction against Wikipedia "making, publishing, or circulating allegedly false, misleading, and defamatory content against ANI".

The case was filed in July 2024 before Justice Navin Chawla in the Delhi High Court as ANI Media Pvt. Ltd. v Wikimedia Foundation Inc & Ors. ANI argued that Wikipedia is a significant social media "intermediary" within the definition of Information Technology Act, 2000, and must therefore comply with the requirements of the Act, including taking down any content that the government or its agencies deem violative, or be personally liable for content published under its platform. Chawla issued a summons to WMF, called the lawsuit "a pure case of defamation" and set a hearing date of 20 August. On 20 August 2024, Chawla ordered WMF to disclose identifying details of three editors (also defendants in the lawsuit) who had worked on the Wikipedia article about ANI to allow ANI to pursue legal action against them as individuals. Chawla ordered WMF to provide the information within two weeks.

On 5 September, ANI asked the court to find WMF in contempt when the identifying details were not released within the time frame. Chawla issued a contempt of court order and threatened to order the government of India to block Wikipedia in the country, saying "We will not take it any more. If you don't like India, please don't work in India...We will close your business transactions here." In response, Wikimedia emphasized that the information in the article was supported by multiple reliable secondary sources. Chawla ordered that an "authorised representative" of WMF appear in person at the next hearing, which was scheduled for 25 October 2024.

On 14 October, Delhi High Court justices Manmohan and Tushar Rao Gedela objected to the creation of an English Wikipedia article about the defamation case, saying the article "disclos[ed] something about a sub-judice matter" and "will have to be taken down", and scheduled review for 16 October. On 16 October, the court stated that "Accordingly, in the interim, this Court directs that the pages on Wikipedia pertaining to the single judge as well as discussion of the observations of division bench be taken down or deleted within 36 hours".

That's ... confusing.

* The article points out that reliable sources say the media org runs a network of fake news sites pushing BJP propaganda.

* The media org sues Wikipedia.

* The judge threatens to block Wikipedia in India, and demands the doxxing of the editors who made these observations about what sources say.

* Somebody starts a Wikipedia page about this civil case.

* That page now says "The Wikimedia Foundation has suspended access to this page due to an order by the Delhi High Court", but the one the case is about is still up.

Was there no such order about the Asian News International page? Or there was, but the WMF is ignoring that one while complying with this one?

I don't really get it, although "refrain from publishing information about an ongoing trial in case you prejudice the outcome" would be a reasonable request to comply with for ethical reasons. But they make it sound like they were forced to block this page and didn't want to. But not the page this page is about. Huh?

Edit: I think I see now, thanks to the above link about "On-wiki discussion". Something about the vagaries of law means blocking the meta-level article, but not the original one, is necessary if they want to appeal, years down the line when they get a chance. So it's strategic.

Slowly, more citizen rights are being eroded by so-called democratic countries by weaponising legislation to get what the few elite in government want.

Another example was US sanctions against Russia, which led to the Linux kernel maintainers removing Russians. Not all Russians support or endorse the war criminal Putin. Are we going to see Western-allied countries like Apartheid Israel also sanctioned? Probably not. Legislation should not be used as a weapon to promote state propaganda.

Are we really going to block freely-available content on the internet? It seems like decentralisation is key to citizen liberty divorced from any one country's legislation.

The legitimacy of Indian courts is something only Indian citizens and people living in India can decide. Other people may have opinions, but they are more or less irrelevant.

Anyway, the fundamental issue here is that domestic rulings often have international consequences. As a sovereign state, India obviously has the right to ban the Wikimedia Foundation, or any other foreign entity, from doing business within the county. That right is an essential aspect of sovereignty. If they don't like you, they can ban you. But if the Wikimedia Foundation values access to India more than their right to host a particular article, they may choose to comply with the demands of an Indian court, even in matters where the court does not have jurisdiction. And that compliance would technically be voluntary.

That's something only Indian citizens and people living in India can decide. Outsiders may have opinions, but they cannot override the will of the people who have a legitimate standing in the matters of the state.

And note how I included "people living in India" here. Legitimacy is a fuzzy concept. Citizenship is a legal category, and it should not matter for legitimacy as such. But it is widely accepted that citizens living outside their country still have a legitimate standing in the matters of the country. But beyond that, a legitimate government should serve the interests of the people factually living within the country. India does not have a large non-citizen population, and the distinction is mostly irrelevant with them. But some other countries do. If their governments only serve the interests of their citizens, they are fundamentally illegitimate.

That's a common myth. The GDPR doesn't follow citizenship, even if a lot of unofficial guidance wrongly says that.

US-based businesses that aren't branches of companies established in the EU, not targeting people in the EU, and not profiling or otherwise monitoring the behavior of people in the EU are not subject to the GDPR. And "in the EU" cares about where the person's body is, not who issued their passport.

This European Commission summary of GDPR's Article 3 (Territorial scope) is informative:

https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/r...

Here is Article 3 itself: https://gdpr-info.eu/art-3-gdpr/ (unofficial site but generally accurate)

And guidelines (PDF) about Article 3 from the European Data Protection Board: https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/e...

However, your scenario may fall in-scope of the GDPR for a simple reason: the Meta Terms of Service specify that the data controller for users (and non-users) living in the EU is Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, which is a company established in the EU. When the data processor or controller activities are through a company or branch established in the EU, the GDPR applies no matter where in the world the person and the data are.

The problem is that as long as the court thinks it has legitimacy, and the guys with the guns agree, then it doesn't matter whether it "objectively" or by someone else's opinion has legitimacy. It doesn't matter who is "right", it matters who has which power.

Unlike the US, courts from India likely have limited power to affect Wikipedia operations outside of India. However, they can potentially send people to arrest anyone associated with the Wikimedia Foundation within India, and potentially keep them in jail until Wikimedia complies. (They can also have Wikipedia and donations flowing to the foundation blocked in a country representing something like 1/6th of the global population.)

Edit to add: Wikimedia on the other hand, has the power to block the article, then lean back with a giant bucket of popcorn knowing that it will achieve the exact opposite of what the court wanted to achieve.

It can't end. Each sovereign entity is unique, and they interact in an anarchy. There's no way to get kings to treat Moldova the way they treat the united States.

But when the US government orders a Taiwanese company to stop selling chips to a Chinese company that's just fine right?

They don't quite do that.

You will notice they only order US companies to do so.

ASML, however, abides by U.S. export control regulations because that was a requirement for the approval of the acquisition of SVG.

Everything flows from there.

Why not just instead, block access to all Wikipedia in India, get some popcorn and see massive protests overturn the situation (and if not done quickly enough, probably result in overthrow of the government or maybe of state itself, because popular protests tend to escalate beyond their original goals as commonly seen in Latin America).

I wonder how long such a description of a US news outlet like CNN, Fox, NYT or WashPo would last on English Wikipedia.

From the Fox News Wikipedia article

>Fox News has been characterized by many as a propaganda organization.[24][25][26][27][28] Its coverage has included biased and false reporting in favor of the Republican Party, its politicians, and conservative causes,[29][30][31] while portraying the Democratic Party in a negative light.

Too lazy to check the others. The NYT undoubtedly has a lengthy section on the buildup to the Iraq War, where they would have been a "propaganda tool of the incumbent government."

This comment might come across as sarcastic, possibly implying that Wikipedia wouldn't cover such a thing. To be clear, Wikipedia has an entire article entitled "List of The New York Times controversies" (linked from the main article), which does indeed mention the Iraq War (among other things) in the summary, with a section to elaborate, linking to the article on Judith Miller for much more extensive elaboration.

For context, The Caravan is a magazine by the Delhi Press Group that presents itself as "fighting against obscurantism and authoritarianism", and has a big record of getting into legal fights with all kinds of people and organizations (listed here: https://caravanmagazine.in/pages/about-us).

The Ken is just a business news startup out of Bangalore.

The article has not been blocked by Indian government but by Indian judiciary system with a trial, there's a difference. Also trials in India take a lot of time and conclusions are reached after much thought.

Also Wikipedia does not have a good track record of its editors free from misleading articles for defamation and propaganda. I won't trust at all the article in Wikipedia about the war between Wikipedia and ANI. The article (archive) already seems to present the court in a bad flavour.

In an unprecedented move, the Wikimedia Foundation has suspended access to "Asian News International vs. Wikimedia Foundation" (self.wikipedia)

submitted 3 days ago by House_Blaster

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International_vs._Wikimedia_Foundation

The Wikimedia Foundation – the nonprofit which hosts the servers, but does not write the content – has suspended access to the page covering a dispute. Obviously, you cannot read the Wikipedia article to find out more, so I will direct you to Google (for background on the dispute) and this comment from co-founder Jimmy Wales#Comment_from_Jimbo_Wales) (explaining why the Foundation took this unprecedented step).

The TL;DR is that ANI is suing the Foundation for defamation and an Indian court ordered that the page documenting the lawsuit itself be taken down. The Foundation complied to preserve their right to appeal, but this is only intended as a temporary measure.

Disclaimer: I am a volunteer administrator on the English Wikipedia but my views are solely my own and may not represent the views of anyone else, especially the Foundation.

Judge Chawla warned WMF that the court could order the government of India to block Wikipedia in the country, saying "We will not take it any more. If you don't like India, please don't work in India... We will close your business transactions here."

Why aren't they just blocking access to this page when trying to view it from an Indian IP address ? Why should the rest of the world have to be subjected to the ruling of some random court ?

Should a court from bumfuck-istan (population 200) be able to also rule that the Wikimedia foundation should suspend access to the entire website worldwide ? Would the foundation obey that ruling too ? If no then what is the criteria for blocking access to a page world wide ?

    permalinkembedsavereportreply

[–]Alpha3031 47 points 2 days ago 

The Foundation does not currently have the technical capability to block read access from specific regions, and given how rare office actions have been it's probably not a priority to create one. They also decline state requests, for example, Wikipedia (all language versions) was blocked in Turkey from May 2017 to January 2020 as the Foundation declined to remove content related to Turkey's involvement with state terror.

Now, I am not a lawyer, nor employed with the Foundation, so this is mostly speculation, but there could be a number of factors why they chose to remove the page in this case. For one, as Jimbo stated, the Foundation wishes to preserve their right to appeal, which would be preferable in the long term. Additionally, I suspect the expectation is for the removal to be quite limited, both in scope (just the one page) and duration. There is also the fact that there was only 36 hours to respond to the order, meaning that even if they would choose to shut down in India, they wouldn't be able to make the decision in time. I expect the Foundation's counsel to make such decisions on a case-by-case basis, so there would likely not be any hard and fast rules, but the ultimate aim is to continue to carry out their mission, and the counsel would be cognisant of that in their advice.

[–]Alkasuz 19 points 3 days ago 

This is what I'm wondering also... If the foundation is headquartered in the US and their servers are there, why should they care? It's obviously outside the jurisdiction of the court.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]uluvboobs 7 points 3 days ago 

Well, I thought if they wanted to play hardball they could just block all wikipedia for India and that would probably screw with whoever was thought to have caused that, but given it's a charitable foundation they are probably trying to do what they can to keep giving access to citizens in India, which includes complying with court orders.

[–]TessHKM 0 points 3 days ago 

Idk probably being a major country with a population of 1.5 billion?

[–]FaceDeer 6 points 2 days ago 

Wikimedia Foundation was given just 36 hours to comply, I'm sure this is just a temporary measure while sorting out their options. This isn't urgent breaking need-to-known news, so if it takes a few days or weeks there's no real problem here.

Bit surprised to see it removed from Wikipedia. I wonder if it would be compliant enought to block access to the page in India alone.

    permalinkembedsavereportreply

[–]FaceDeer 5 points 2 days ago 

They had just 36 hours to comply, they may not have had the technical setup required for a fine-grained block like that. And possibly the court order demanded a global block, which would of course be bullshit but might be bullshit that Wikimedia Foundation is willing to temporarily put up with for the sake of winning the court battle in the longer term.

[–]Highpersonic 9 points 3 days ago 

Tangentially related: Why are they using "crore" as a denominator? We don't use "man" or "sen" when writing about larger numbers of yen despite the fact that the japanese counting system is based on that - the english one isn't.

    permalinkembedsavereportreply

[–]caeciliusinhorto 26 points 2 days ago 

Because crore and lakh are used in Indian English, whereas there is no Japanese variety of English which used man and sen. Use of crore/lakh is discouraged (MOS:COMMONALITY says "using vocabulary common to all varieties of English is preferable") but is permissible (MOS:CRORE)

Thanks for the heads-up. It's really confusing to have a random foreign word popping up in the middle of a sentence, mostly without explanation. I'll gnome those away if i see them.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]4051 19 points 2 days ago 

Indian people speak English as lingua franca and use the crore as denominator, therefore it makes perfect sense for it to be used in Indian English.

[–]Qwernakus 2 points 2 days ago 

I don't like this very much, though it calms me a little that Jimmy Wales is in support of the decision. On the surface this seems like a bad call, since it sets a dangerous precedent. I hope to be wrong.
