Sure! Here are some technical questions and answers tailored for a .NET Developer role, along with concise code examples where appropriate:

### 1. Explain the difference between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` in .NET.
**Answer:**
- `IEnumerable<T>` is used for in-memory collections and provides forward-only iteration over a collection of a specified type.
- `IQueryable<T>` is used for querying data from out-of-memory collections like databases. It allows for querying with LINQ and can translate queries to the underlying data source.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Using IEnumerable
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
IEnumerable<int> evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);

// Using IQueryable
IQueryable<int> queryableNumbers = numbers.AsQueryable();
IQueryable<int> evenQueryableNumbers = queryableNumbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
```

### 2. How do you handle exceptions in ASP.NET Core?
**Answer:**
In ASP.NET Core, exceptions can be handled using middleware. The `UseExceptionHandler` middleware can be configured to handle exceptions globally.

**Example:**
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

### 3. What are Angular services and how are they used?
**Answer:**
Angular services are singleton objects that are instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. They are used to share data and functionality across components.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Creating a service
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  private data: string[] = [];

  addData(item: string) {
    this.data.push(item);
  }

  getData(): string[] {
    return this.data;
  }
}

// Using the service in a component
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-data',
  template: `<div *ngFor="let item of data">{{ item }}</div>`,
})
export class DataComponent {
  data: string[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {
    this.data = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

### 4. How do you optimize SQL queries for better performance?
**Answer:**
To optimize SQL queries, you can:
- Use proper indexing.
- Avoid using `SELECT *`.
- Use joins instead of subqueries.
- Optimize the use of `WHERE` clauses.
- Analyze and optimize query execution plans.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Using indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON Employees(Name);

-- Optimized query
SELECT Name, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

### 5. Explain the concept of Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core.
**Answer:**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class in various ways.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Registering services in Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}

// Using DI in a controller
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;

    public HomeController(IMyService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var data = _myService.GetData();
        return View(data);
    }
}
```

Sure! Here are some technical questions and answers tailored for a .NET Developer role, along with concise code examples where appropriate:

### 1. What is the difference between `Task` and `Thread` in .NET?
**Answer:**
- `Task` represents an asynchronous operation and is part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL). It is used for parallel programming and can return a result.
- `Thread` represents a thread of execution in a program. It is a lower-level construct compared to `Task`.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Using Task
Task.Run(() => {
    Console.WriteLine("Task running");
});

// Using Thread
Thread thread = new Thread(() => {
    Console.WriteLine("Thread running");
});
thread.Start();
```

### 2. How do you implement dependency injection in ASP.NET Core?
**Answer:**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. ASP.NET Core has built-in support for DI.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Registering services in Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}

// Using DI in a controller
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;

    public HomeController(IMyService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var data = _myService.GetData();
        return View(data);
    }
}
```

```typescript
// Creating a service
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({

export class DataService {
  private data: string[] = [];

  addData(item: string) {
    this.data.push(item);
  }

  getData(): string[] {
    return this.data;
  }
}

// Using the service in a component
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-data',
  template: `<div *ngFor="let item of data">{{ item }}</div>`,
})
export class DataComponent {
  data: string[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {
    this.data = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

- Use proper indexing.
- Avoid using `SELECT *`.
- Use joins instead of subqueries.
- Optimize the use of `WHERE` clauses.
- Analyze and optimize query execution plans.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Using indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON Employees(Name);

-- Optimized query
SELECT Name, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

### 5. Explain the concept of Middleware in ASP.NET Core.
**Answer:**
Middleware are software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each component chooses whether to pass the request to the next component in the pipeline.

**Example:**
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        // Do work before the next middleware
        await next.Invoke();
        // Do work after the next middleware
    });

    app.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

Explain each of these with  simple, complete, concise, self-contained code examples. 
### How do you optimize SQL queries for better performance?
**Answer:**
To optimize SQL queries, you can:
- Use proper indexing.
- Avoid using `SELECT *`.
- Use joins instead of subqueries.
- Optimize the use of `WHERE` clauses.
- Analyze and optimize query execution plans.

Sure! Here are explanations and examples for each optimization technique:

### 1. Use Proper Indexing
Indexes help speed up the retrieval of rows by using pointers. They are essential for improving query performance.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Create an index on the 'Name' column of the 'Employees' table
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON Employees(Name);

-- Query using the indexed column
SELECT Name, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Name = 'John Doe';
```

### 2. Avoid Using `SELECT *`
Using `SELECT *` retrieves all columns, which can be inefficient. Instead, specify only the columns you need.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Inefficient query
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';

-- Optimized query
SELECT Name, Department FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

### 3. Use Joins Instead of Subqueries
Joins are generally more efficient than subqueries because they can take advantage of indexing and other optimizations.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Using a subquery
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT ID FROM Departments WHERE Name = 'IT');

-- Using a join
SELECT Employees.Name
FROM Employees
JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.ID
WHERE Departments.Name = 'IT';
```

### 4. Optimize the Use of `WHERE` Clauses
Ensure that your `WHERE` clauses are optimized to use indexes and avoid unnecessary computations.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Inefficient query
SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE YEAR(HireDate) = 2020;

-- Optimized query
SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE HireDate BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31';
```

### 5. Analyze and Optimize Query Execution Plans
Use the database's execution plan feature to analyze and optimize your queries.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Analyze the execution plan for a query
EXPLAIN SELECT Name, Department FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';

-- Based on the execution plan, you might add indexes or rewrite the query for better performance
```
