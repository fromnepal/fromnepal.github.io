Sometimes, I have a vague idea such as this: 
We should try to make the batteries in our phones and tablets last longer. 
Which then leads me to a belief grounded on nothing but my own vague idea: 
1. Apps running in the background without my explicit knowledge and permission are bad for battery. 
2. No apps should be able to run in the background without my explicit knowledge and permission. 
Then someone brings up something like: 
But what about email clients? 
Me: OK yes, I need email clients to be able to fetch emails without manual intervention. 
Them: What about phone calls? 
Me: Yes, obviously I want to be able to receive phone calls. 
Them: Text messages? 
Me: Yes, texts too. 
Them: Signal messages? 
Me: Yes, Signal messages as well. 
Them: Whatsapp... 
Me: Ok, ok maybe it was a bad idea to say apps should not run in the background. 
What was wrong with my thought process? 
Was it that I came up with a belief without thinking something through? 






















Copilot: 
It sounds like you were trying to find a balance between conserving battery life and maintaining the functionality of your apps. Your initial thought process wasn't entirely wrong, but it did overlook some practical considerations. Here are a few points to consider:
1. **Generalization**: Your initial belief that no apps should run in the background was too broad. While it's true that some apps can drain battery life unnecessarily, others are essential for the functionality of your device, like email clients, messaging apps, and phone services.
2. **Exceptions and Nuances**: As you discussed with others, you realized that there are necessary exceptions to your rule. This shows that while your idea had a good intention, it needed more nuance to account for different types of apps and their purposes.
3. **Practicality**: The practicality of your idea was challenged when you considered real-world applications. It's important to think through how a belief or idea will work in practice, not just in theory.
4. **Iterative Thinking**: Your conversation highlights the importance of iterative thinking. It's okay to start with a broad idea and then refine it as you gather more information and feedback.
In summary, your thought process was a good starting point, but it needed refinement and consideration of practical exceptions. It's a common experience to start with a broad idea and then adjust it as you think through the details and receive feedback. This iterative process is a valuable part of critical thinking and problem-solving. ðŸ˜Š

Your thought process illustrates a common cognitive pattern where an initial idea or belief is formed based on a vague notion, and then it encounters challenges when confronted with specific examples that contradict or complicate that belief. Here are a few aspects of your thought process that may have contributed to the confusion:
1. **Overgeneralization**: You started with a broad statement about background apps being bad for battery life without considering the nuances of different types of apps and their functions. Not all background activity is detrimental; some are essential for the functionality of the device.
2. **Lack of Specificity**: Your initial belief lacked specificity regarding which apps or types of background activity you were concerned about. This made it difficult to defend your position when specific examples were presented.
3. **Failure to Consider Exceptions**: When you encountered examples of essential services (like email, phone calls, and messaging apps), it highlighted that your belief did not account for the necessity of certain background processes. This is a common issue when forming beliefs without a comprehensive understanding of the topic.
4. **Cognitive Dissonance**: As you were challenged with examples, you experienced cognitive dissonanceâ€”the discomfort of holding two conflicting beliefs (wanting to save battery life vs. needing certain apps to function). This led you to reconsider your initial stance.
5. **Need for Critical Thinking**: Your thought process could benefit from more critical thinking and analysis. Before forming a belief, it can be helpful to consider potential counterarguments and the complexity of the issue.
In summary, your initial belief was formed without thorough consideration of the complexities involved in app functionality and battery usage. Engaging in more critical thinking and being open to exceptions can help refine your beliefs in the future.
