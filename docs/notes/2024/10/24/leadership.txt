The following Amazon Leadership Principles are missing from your list:

1. **Are Right, A Lot**: Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
2. **Hire and Develop the Best**: Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization.
3. **Think Big**: Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
4. **Bias for Action**: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.
5. **Frugality**: Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
6. **Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer**: Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment.
7. **Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility**: Leaders are humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of their actions. They create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them¹(https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles)²(https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles).
