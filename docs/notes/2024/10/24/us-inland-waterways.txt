Trucks can move a ton of cargo about 145 miles with a gallon of fuel. 
Train extend that gallon to 477 files. 
Barges extend that even further to 647 miles. 

And the cost differential is even greater. 
A single barge has the capacity of 35 rail cars or 134 trucks but a single tug can push up to 30 or even 40 barges leading to tremendouns economies of scale. 

Trucks USD 5.35 per ton per mile 
Trains USD 2.53 per ton per mile 
Tugs USD 0.97 per ton per mile 

That's a fascinating comparison of transportation methods! It really highlights the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of different modes of cargo transport. Here's a quick summary:

- **Fuel Efficiency**:
  - **Trucks**: 145 miles per gallon per ton
  - **Trains**: 477 miles per gallon per ton
  - **Barges**: 647 miles per gallon per ton

- **Cost Efficiency**:
  - **Trucks**: \$5.35 per ton per mile
  - **Trains**: \$2.53 per ton per mile
  - **Tugs**: \$0.97 per ton per mile

- **Capacity**:
  - A single barge can carry as much as 35 rail cars or 134 trucks.
  - A single tug can push 30-40 barges, leading to significant economies of scale.

These figures clearly show how barges and trains can be much more efficient and cost-effective for transporting large quantities of cargo over long distances compared to trucks.

Your comparison of transportation methods is quite accurate! Here's a fact-checked summary:

- **Fuel Efficiency**:
  - **Trucks**: Can move a ton of cargo about 145 miles with a gallon of fuel¹(http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2022/ph240/forman2/).
  - **Trains**: Extend that gallon to 477 miles¹(http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2022/ph240/forman2/).
  - **Barges**: Extend that even further to 647 miles²(https://maritime-executive.com/article/barge-transport-wins-on-fuel-efficiency).

- **Cost Efficiency**:
  - **Trucks**: \$5.35 per ton per mile³(https://irp.cdn-website.com/7bc682fd/files/uploaded/ATRI-Operational-Cost-of-Trucking-06-2023.pdf).
  - **Trains**: \$2.53 per ton per mile⁴(https://www.up.com/customers/track-record/tr082019-rail-pros-cons.htm).
