        <h2>Number twelve WILL shock you!!!!1 zomg!!!1</h2>
        <h2>Stocks Rally a Day After Fed’s Big Interest Rate Cut</h2>
        <p>The S&P 500 had already been climbing as investors grew more confident that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by half a percentage point. Thursday’s gain put the index in range of a closing record.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 was on course to notch a record on Thursday after a momentous cut to interest rates from the Federal Reserve invigorated a market rally.</p>
        <p>The index rose roughly 1.7 percent by midday, climbing past its last closing record, reached in July. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies more sensitive to the ebb and flow of the economy rose about 1.8 percent on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 has repeatedly butted up against the record in recent weeks, lifted recently as investors anticipated a big cut to interest rates. On Wednesday, the Fed met those expectations by lowering its benchmark interest rate by half of a percentage point, double the typical quarter-point adjustment the central bank typically makes.</p>
        <p>Though stocks had wobbled in the immediate aftermath of the rate cut, closing slightly lower on Wednesday, optimism took hold in the markets overnight. It often takes the market a day or two to determine a path after a big event like the Fed meeting. Lower rates are generally good news for stock investors: lower borrowing costs boost corporate profits and increase the value of investors’ holdings.</p>
        <p>“This can only be a good thing for equities,” said Colin Graham, head of multi asset strategies at Robeco, an asset management firm.</p>
        <p>Investors also have to consider, however, that the Fed’s aggressive cutting could mean that policymakers are worried about the economy.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, appeared to tread that tightrope carefully.</p>
        <p>“The U.S. economy is in a good place, and our decision today is designed to keep it there,” Mr. Powell said at a news conference after the rate decision was announced.</p>
        <p>Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at the retail brokerage firm LPL Financial, said that “they made it clear that this is not an emergency rate cut,” which would have spooked the market.</p>
        <p>Financial markets themselves may have been at play in the Fed’s decision to opt for a bigger half percentage cut, said Naomi Fink, a global strategist at Nikko Asset Management. Investors had placed bets on a larger cut leading up to the Fed’s meeting.</p>
        <p>“It is possible that the Fed viewed such conditions as a good time to buy insurance,” Ms. Fink said, “while the markets were likely to absorb it well, in case conditions were not so amenable in the future.”</p>
        <p>The question left lingering in investors’ minds is whether companies can continue to deliver the financial results to justify such lofty valuations. And that’s not the only risk. Geopolitics, the U.S. presidential election and a softening labor market could also curtail the rally over the next couple of months.</p>
        <h2>Interest Rates Fall, but Central Banks Are No Longer in Lock Step</h2>
        <p>Officials in some countries started cutting rates last year, but others, including those in Europe and the United States, have taken a more cautious approach.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, central banks around the world were engaged in a battle against high inflation that resulted in an aggressive and synchronized jump in interest rates. Now, many policymakers are reversing course — but in a less coordinated way as price increases slow at different paces in various countries.</p>
        <p>Central bankers in some emerging markets began cutting rates last year. European officials started a slow and cautious easing of interest rates just a few months ago. The biggest outlier had been the Federal Reserve, which had kept rates high for more than a year and throughout the summer. On Wednesday, it joined the crowd and cut rates — in a big way — for the first time since the early days of the pandemic.</p>
        <p>“A few months ago, we were still in the space of American exceptionalism,” said Katharine Neiss, an economist at PGIM Fixed Income, an asset manager. There was the expectation that the resilience of the U.S. economy would lead to higher rates for longer, she said. “That was creating a lot of stresses and strains for the rest of the world,” she added.</p>
        <p>If the Fed’s rate cut on Wednesday can ensure a so-called soft landing for the U.S. economy, where inflation is brought down without a severe recession, then that is “really good news for the rest of the world,” Ms. Neiss said. It also eases global financial conditions and reduces pressure on currencies that were taking a hit from the dollar’s strength.</p>
        <p>Now, the dominant theme around the world is central banks lowering interest rates as inflation slows, falling within sight of their targets, and economic growth weakens. Still, policymakers have been cautious about moving too quickly and reigniting inflationary pressures.</p>
        <p>The Bank of Canada has cut rates three times since June. Last week, the European Central Bank cut interest rates for the second time in three months. The Bank of England held rates steady on Thursday after cutting just once last month.</p>
        <p>Central banks in Norway and Sweden are also expected to hold rates at their meetings later in September, emphasizing their gradual approach. Among emerging markets, the South African central bank cut rates for the first time in four years on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Still, there are global outliers. Japan belatedly responded to rising inflation by raising rates in July. Investors suggest that the Bank of Japan is more likely to raise rates again in the near future. Nigeria has been raising rates this year as inflation has jumped and, late on Wednesday, Brazil's central bank raised rates amid concerns that faster economic growth could be inflationary.</p>
        <h2>30-Year Mortgage Rate Drops to 6.09% After Fed Rate Cut</h2>
        <p>The decline in mortgage costs, influenced by expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate moves, could revive interest in buying, selling and remortgaging, economists said.</p>
        <p>Mortgage rates dropped again this week, extending a monthslong decline fueled by expectations of a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which came into fruition on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The average rate on 30-year mortgages, the most popular home loan in the United States, fell to 6.09 percent this week, Freddie Mac reported on Thursday. That was down from 6.2 percent a week earlier, reaching the lowest level since February 2023. Rates have fallen about one percentage point over the past four months, and are significantly lower than their peak at nearly 7.8 percent late last year.</p>
        <p>The downward drift in rates toward 6 percent is “reviving purchase and refinance demand for many consumers,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Here’s what else to know about the trends in mortgage rates:</p>
        <p>The Fed’s decision on Wednesday to slash its benchmark interest rate by a higher-than-usual half percentage point was already partly reflected in mortgage rates over the past few months. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages tend to track the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which can be influenced by market expectations for Fed moves.</p>
        <p>Prospective buyers and sellers may not see a drastic drop in mortgage rates as a result of the Fed’s move this week, economists said. The Fed’s rate cut came alongside economic projections by officials that suggested a rapid pace of rate cuts in the months ahead, which could lead to even lower mortgage costs. “Declining mortgage rates over the last several weeks indicate this cut was mostly baked in, but we expect rates to fall further, sparking more housing activity,” Mr. Khater said.</p>
        <p>Mortgage rates are still twice as high as they were three years ago, at the height of the pandemic, when the average 30-year rate was around 3 percent. Many potential sellers remain reluctant to put their homes on the market, unwilling to part with lower rates on their existing mortgages. Even with this week’s drop, there is a notable gap between current mortgage rates and those many homeowners locked during the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Existing home sales fell 2.5 percent in August, the National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday. But there are signs that the housing market could eventually get a boost from falling mortgage rates: As rates fall toward 6 percent, more prospective sellers could list their homes, boosting inventory, according to analysts at Oxford Economics.</p>
        <p>Some banks and mortgage lenders said they were already seeing an uptick in interest among prospective buyers, tied to the Fed’s rate cutting cycle. “This is the moment we’ve been waiting for and millions of borrowers across the country will benefit from this decision,” said Alex Elezaj, chief strategy officer at United Wholesale Mortgage. But home prices remain high, which could continue to constrain first-time buyers in particular, despite cheaper loan payments.</p>

        <h2>The Fed’s Big Rate Cut Wasn’t Political. It Was an Economic No-Brainer.</h2>
        <p>In one sense, you could say that Wednesday’s decision by the Federal Reserve to cut rates was of minimal importance. The interest rate the Fed more or less directly controls — the federal funds rate — is the rate at which banks lend one another money overnight. And it’s hard to think of any businesses or consumers who will change their plans because the annualized interest rate on one-day borrowing has fallen a half a percentage point, from around 5.5 percent to around 5 percent — which means that if you borrow $1,000, your repayment the next day falls by 1.4 cents.</p>
        <p>Yet it was a momentous move all the same. For one thing, Fed rate changes tend to percolate into longer-term interest rates that really do matter for the economy. For example, the series of rate hikes the Fed undertook in 2022 and 2023 drove 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates up to almost 8 percent from about 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Even more important, by beginning to cut rates, the Fed — which began raising rates in 2022 in an attempt to control surging inflation — in effect declared its belief that the war on inflation has been won.</p>
        <p>Why should we care what the Fed thinks? Let me tell you a secret: Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, and his colleagues don’t have any inside information about the state of the economy. (OK, they might have advance warning if, say, a major bank is about to fail.) Most of their decisions are based on the same data about unemployment, inflation and so on available to anyone with an internet connection.</p>
        <p>It’s true that the Fed has some very smart economists on its staff. But there are plenty of smart economists outside the Fed, too. The implicit declaration that inflation has been defeated won’t come as news to anyone who has, for example, been following Mark Zandi at Moody’s or Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs, who have been telling us for months that inflation is under control.</p>
        <p>Yet the Fed gains some perceived gravitas from its policy role, which means that its opinion carries special weight with investors and, perhaps more important, the general public.</p>
        <p>So it matters that the Fed is now sounding the all-clear on inflation. But this good news raises two questions.</p>
        <p>First, if inflation is, as Powell said in his news conference, close to the Fed’s target of 2 percent, why didn’t he and his colleagues cut rates even more?</p>
        <p>The Fed committee that sets interest rates, which meets eight times a year, normally moves those rates gradually — a quarter point at a time. The big debate before this meeting was whether this would be a standard quarter-point cut or, what we actually got, a “jumbo” half-point cut.</p>
        <p>But instead of thinking in terms of increments, suppose we just ask what interest-rate level makes sense at this point. Inflation appears to be under control; labor markets appear to be weakening, with unemployment still fairly low but up significantly from its low point last year and hiring falling off. Overall, as Powell said in his news conference, the labor market looks a bit cooler than it was on the eve of the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Yet the overnight rate was 1.75 percent at the end of 2019. There are some iffy arguments to the effect that we can maintain full employment at a somewhat higher interest rate now; participants in Wednesday’s committee meeting projected on average that the interest rate will settle at 2.9 percent. But I haven’t seen any plausible case for a “neutral” rate higher than 4 percent at the most. Yet despite the jumbo cut, rates are still at 5 percent. Shouldn’t the Fed be moving more quickly to normalize rates (and minimize the risk of a recession)?</p>
        <p>Second, will the Fed’s all-clear do anything to persuade more Americans to re-evaluate President Biden’s economic record? We did experience a temporary burst of inflation in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, but so did almost every other major economy, while we have generally had much stronger growth than our peers have. And as White House economists have pointed out, our success in getting inflation back down has defied the expectations of commentators who insisted that disinflation would require a big rise in unemployment.</p>
        <p>I know that some people aren’t satisfied with returning to low inflation; they want to see us get the level of consumer prices back to what it was before the pandemic. But we can’t, and even trying would be a really bad idea. Over the past century, only one president has presided over a significant decline in consumer prices; his name was Herbert Hoover.</p>
        <p>Today’s Fed move is, of course, good for Kamala Harris. It will give consumers some direct relief on interest costs, and it will signal that high inflation is in the rear view mirror. And having Powell say, as he did in his news conference, that the economy is in “good shape” has to be helpful for a candidate who is part of the administration presiding over that economy.</p>
        <p>And almost too predictably, Donald Trump jumped in to suggest that the Fed might be “playing politics.”</p>
        <p>But while the Fed’s action will surely have political consequences, it wasn’t a political decision. The straight economic case for a rate cut was overwhelming; the case for a big cut was very strong. Not cutting would have been political. And the Fed didn’t let itself be bullied into inaction.</p>
        <h2>I Just Went to Darfur. Here Is What Shattered Me.</h2>
        <p>When an Arab militia rampaged through Maryam Suleiman’s village in the Darfur region of Sudan last year and lined up men and boys to massacre, the gunmen were blunt about their purpose.</p>
        <p>“We don’t want to see any Black people,” a militia leader said, adding mockingly: “We don’t even want to see black trash bags.” To make his point, Maryam recalled, he shot a donkey because it was black.</p>
        <p>Then the militia members executed men and boys who belonged to Black African ethnic groups, she said. “They shot my five brothers, one after the other,” Maryam told me, describing how her youngest brother survived the first bullet and called out to her. Then a militia member shot him in the head and sneeringly asked her what she thought of that.</p>
        <p>The militia tried to systematically kill all the males over 10, Maryam said, and also killed some younger ones. A 1-day-old boy was thrown to the ground and killed, and one male infant was thrown into a pond to drown, she said.</p>
        <p>The gunmen then rounded up the women and girls in a corral to rape, she added. “They raped many, many girls,” she recalled. One man tried to rape Maryam, she said, and when he failed he beat her. She was pregnant and suffered a miscarriage.</p>
        <p>“You’re slaves,” Maryam quoted the militia members as saying. “There is no place for you Black people in Sudan.” So Maryam fled to neighboring Chad and is one of more than 10 million Sudanese who have been forcibly displaced since a civil war began last year in the country and ignited pogroms against Black African ethnic groups like hers.</p>
        <p>The atrocities underway near here are an echo of the Darfur genocide of two decades ago, with the additional complication of famine. But there’s a crucial difference: At that time, world leaders, celebrities and university students vigorously protested the slaughter and joined forces to save hundreds of thousands of lives. Today, in contrast, the world is distracted and silent. So the impunity is allowing violence to go unchecked, which, in turn, is producing what may become the worst famine in half a century or more.</p>
        <p>“It’s beyond anything we’ve ever seen,” Cindy McCain, the executive director of the United Nations World Food Program, told me. “It’s catastrophic.”</p>
        <p>“Unless,” she added, “we can get our job done.”</p>
        <p>World leaders will convene next week in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly, but they have been mostly indifferent and are unlikely to get the job done. What’s needed is far greater pressure to end the civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the rival Arab militia, while pushing the warring parties to allow humanitarian access. All sides in the war are behaving irresponsibly, so more than half the people of Sudan — 25 million people — have become acutely malnourished already. A famine was formally declared in one area in Sudan in the summer.</p>
        <p>Timmo Gaasbeek, a disaster expert who has modeled the crisis for a research institute in the Netherlands, told me that he foresees 13 million people starving to death in Sudan by October 2025, with a margin of error of two million. Such a toll would make this one of the worst famines in world history and the worst since the great Chinese famine of 65 years ago. By way of contrast, the famous Ukraine famine of the 1930s killed perhaps four million people, although estimates vary.</p>
        <p>I can’t verify that a cataclysm of that level is approaching. Warring parties blocked me from entering Sudanese areas they controlled, so I reported along the Chad-Sudan border. Arriving refugees described starvation but not yet mass mortality from malnutrition.</p>
        <p>All I can say is that whether or not a cataclysmic famine is probable, it is a significant risk. Those in danger are people like Thuraya Muhammad, a slight 17-year-old orphan who told me how her world unraveled when the Rapid Support Forces, the same group that killed Maryam’s five brothers, attacked her village and began burning homes and shooting men and boys.</p>
        <p>“So many men were killed, like grains of sand,” she told me.</p>
        <p>After slaughtering the men in Thuraya’s village, the militia raped many women and girls, she said. Thuraya’s cousin, a woman of 20, was among those kidnapped by the militia and hasn’t been seen since, she added.</p>
        <p>Thuraya’s father was murdered by the militia and her mother had died earlier, so at 16 she was now the head of the household. She led her younger brother and two younger sisters to safety by walking to the Chadian border town of Adré. Gunmen tried to rob them several times, but the family had nothing left to steal.</p>
        <p>Now in a refugee camp in Chad, Thuraya works to feed her siblings. Like other refugees, she gets a monthly food allotment from the World Food Program that helps but is insufficient. She supports her family by seeking day jobs washing clothes or cleaning houses (for about 25 cents a day). When she finds work, she and her siblings eat; if not, they may go hungry.</p>
        <p>When I dropped by their hut, Thuraya had been unable to find work that day. A friendly neighbor had given her a cup of coffee, but she hadn’t eaten anything since the previous day — and there was no prospect of dinner, either. If there is no food, Thuraya told me, she serves water to her siblings in place of dinner.</p>
        <p>She wept.</p>
        <p>Thuraya wasn’t crying from her own pangs of hunger. Rather, tears tumbled silently down her cheeks out of shame at her inability to feed her brother and sisters.</p>
        <p>“When there isn’t enough food, I give it to my sisters and brother,” she told me, and her younger sister Fatima confirmed that. “I go hungry, or else my neighbors may call me over to eat with them.”</p>
        <p>“I’d rather my sisters and brother eat, because they cry when they go hungry,” she said. “And I can’t bear to hear them cry.”</p>
        <p>Fatima resists the favoritism and tries to give her sister back some food. But Thuraya won’t take it and goes out, telling her brother and sisters to eat while she finds something for herself. They all know that in a refugee camp of about 200,000 hungry people, she will find nothing.</p>
        <p>I’m hoping that Thuraya’s fortitude might inspire President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, along with world leaders gathering at the United Nations, to summon a similar resolve to tackle slaughter and starvation in Sudan. Donor nations have contributed less than half the sum needed by U.N. agencies to ease Sudan’s food crisis, and they have not insisted forcefully on either providing humanitarian access or on cutting off the flow of weapons that sustains the war.</p>
        <p>Biden, who 20 years ago savaged President George W. Bush for not doing enough to stop the Darfur genocide, has provided aid and appointed a special envoy to push for peace talks but has said little about the current crisis. An American partner, the United Arab Emirates, supplies weapons to the militia that slaughtered and raped Thuraya’s neighbors, yet Biden has not publicly demanded that the Emirates cut off that support for killers and rapists.</p>
        <p>The upshot of this neglect is the risk not only of a horrendous famine but also of endless war, Sudan’s fragmentation, enormous refugee flows and instability across the region.</p>
        <p>So as world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly tuck into fine banquets next week to celebrate their humanitarianism, may they be awakened by thoughts of an orphan of Darfur who ignores her own hunger and divides scraps of bread among her brother and sisters.</p>
        <p>Thuraya has no reason to feel ashamed that her siblings are hungry; the shame belongs to those who are powerful, well fed and blind.</p>
        <h2>Inflation Is Ebbing. Now the Fed Must Protect Jobs.</h2>
        <p>For the last three years, the Federal Reserve has been fighting to bring inflation down. Now it has boldly moved to protect the second half of its dual mandate: to keep employment strong.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the Fed broke with precedent and cut its policy interest rate by 0.5 percentage point instead of the usual 0.25. The decision, which surprised many, is good for the economy and begins the last phase of the Fed’s policy response to the Covid pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, the Fed rapidly slashed rates effectively to zero to keep the economy afloat — only to drastically change course and raise rates just as rapidly in 2022, when inflation spiked. With this week’s decision, the Fed has brought the federal funds rate, now in a target range of 4.75 percent to 5 percent, a step toward pre-pandemic norms.</p>
        <p>The Fed has now clearly signaled that it is starting to wind down its battle against inflation. And for good reason. Personal consumption expenditure inflation, its preferred measure, was 2.5 percent in July, and while that’s still somewhat elevated, it’s about a third of the peak in 2022. The data has shown inflation falling for much of the past two years. Even after this cut, the funds rate remains high enough to discourage some borrowing and spending, so the Fed is still fighting inflation by restraining demand.</p>
        <p>Unlike many other central banks, however, the Fed has a mandate for maximum employment along with price stability, and the decision for a larger cut also signals that it is taking seriously recent signs of slowing in the labor market. That’s appropriate. Over the past two months, data has indicated that the labor market was not as strong as the Fed thought. Where things stand is largely fine — the unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, and monthly payroll gains are only somewhat below their strong pace before the pandemic — but the trend is worrisome. The labor market is cooling off.</p>
        <p>The increase in the unemployment rate over the past year is in line with increases early in past recessions. While that indicator, the so-called Sahm rule (yes, I came up with it), has accurately forecast prior recessions, it and other economic rules of thumb are too simple for this complicated, post-pandemic time. The United States is not in a recession or even on the verge of one. G.D.P. is on track to grow about 3 percent for the second straight quarter.</p>
        <p>Still, a larger rate cut now allows the Fed toreduce the risk. The level of the funds rate was too high given the progress on inflation and the cooling in the labor market. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, referred to the cut as a “recalibration.”</p>
        <p>A half-point cut is a big deal. Typically, when cutting rates, the Fed sticks to smaller, one-quarter-point increments unless there is intense economic or financial market strain. March 2020, when the pandemic struck, and October 2008, during a financial crisis because of the housing market collapse, were the last two half-percentage point cuts, and they fit the standard playbook. That naturally led some commentators to worry that Wednesday’s cut would signal that the economy is in crisis.</p>
        <p>That may explain why this move raised dissent. One Fed governor, Michelle Bowman, preferred a quarter-percentage-point cut — the first dissent from a governor since 2005.</p>
        <p>That makes sense. This was a tough call. Given the uncertainties in the economic environment, differences will arise. Waiting to build a full consensus would have slowed down the adjustment in the policy rate, and suppressing the dissenting vote would have conveyed false certainty to the public. It is good for Mr. Powell to establish that dissent is welcome, as the Fed begins what could be two years of similarly contentious decisions.</p>
        <p>We can expect more rate cuts down the road. According to the Fed’s new forecasts, as inflation falls most Fed officials expect to be able to reduce the funds rate by at least an additional percentage point and a half before the end of 2025. But that assumes only a small increase in unemployment, and forecasts have been proved wrong repeatedly in the past four years. The large, first rate cut underscores the Fed’s willingness to pivot as it gets new information, and to not be tied to the past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powell was blunt when he said last month at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium that further cooling in labor market conditions was not welcome or necessary. This week, he declared that “the time to support the labor market is when it’s strong and not when we begin to see the layoffs.”</p>
        <p>With this statement and this cut, Mr. Powell is cementing his legacy as someone who embraces both sides of the agency’s dual mandate. With solid growth, relatively low unemployment and the stock market near record highs, the Fed chose to cut from a position of strength to preserve that strength.</p>
        <h2>Israel Strikes Lebanon in Wake of Hezbollah Threat to Retaliate, Officials Say</h2>
        <p>Israel carried out one of the most intense bombardments of the past year, as warplanes launched 70 airstrikes, Lebanese security officials said. The barrage came shortly after Hezbollah’s leader vowed to respond after explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies killed at least 37 people.</p>
        <p>Here is the latest on the attacks in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon on Thursday, as both countries anxiously faced the prospect of a rapidly escalating conflict. It was one of the largest bombardments in a year of heightened fighting, according to Lebanese officials.</p>
        <p>The airstrikes came soon after the leader of Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based militant group, vowed that “retribution will come” to Israel for the wireless device explosions that targeted his fighters and led to two days of panic in Lebanon this week.</p>
        <p>But even as the Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah, was promising his followers in a speech that Israel would pay, Israeli jet fighters screamed overhead, setting off sonic booms in what seemed a clear show of might.</p>
        <p>Not long after, the skies over southern Lebanon filled with jets, and the booms that followed were from bombs. The Israeli military carried out more than 70 airstrikes across southern Lebanon, according to three senior Lebanese security officials, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media.</p>
        <p>The Israeli bombardment was a marked uptick from the daily tit-for-tat attacks that has characterized the cross-border fighting for the past 11 months. But it appeared to fall short of a major escalation: there were no immediate reports of casualties and the strikes appeared to have avoided both major population centers and the country’s heartland.</p>
        <p>Israel and Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, an Israeli nemesis, have long been at odds, but tensions have ratcheted up since Israel’s war with another Iranian-backed group, Hamas, began in October. A day after Hamas attacked Israel, setting off the war, Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel in a show of support.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, pagers and walkie-talkies widely used by Hezbollah operatives began exploding all at once across Lebanon, killing dozens and wounding hundreds. The operation has been tied to Israel, though the Israelis have not claimed responsibility for it.</p>
        <p>Here is what else to know:</p>
        <p>Making his first public remarks since the device explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Nasrallah acknowledged that his group had “endured a severe and cruel blow.” But he said Israel would “face just retribution and a bitter reckoning,” accusing the country of breaking “all conventions and laws.” He left his threat vague. “I will not discuss time, nor manner, nor place,” Mr. Nasrallah said.  He also promised that the exploding-device attacks would not deter Hezbollah from continuing to launch rockets and drones at Israel in support of Hamas.</p>
        <p>The Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck at least 100 rocket launchers belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, along with other infrastructure sites and weapon storage facilities. For its part, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for 17 attacks in northern Israel on Thursday. It targeted barracks and military bases with rockets, missiles and drones. The Israeli military said two soldiers had been killed in combat in northern Israel but did not provide details.</p>
        <p>Walkie-talkies: The Japanese company whose name was on the two-way radios that exploded said Thursday that it had discontinued that model a decade ago and had warned of fake versions.</p>
        <p>The exploding wireless devices that targeted members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah this week have set off a debate among experts in international law: Are such attacks legal? Specifically, legal scholars and advocates are asking whether it violates the laws of war to detonate secretly installed explosives in thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies when it is virtually impossible to know who else might be in the vicinity.</p>
        <p>President Emmanuel Macron of France said he called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and told him that war in Lebanon "must be avoided,” adding that “a diplomatic path exists. Escalation is in no one’s interest."</p>
        <p>Experts are divided over whether the wireless device attacks in Lebanon were legal.</p>
        <p>The exploding wireless devices that targeted members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah this week have set off a debate among experts in international law: Are such attacks legal?</p>
        <p>Specifically, legal scholars and advocates are asking whether it violates the laws of war to detonate secretly installed explosives in thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies when it is virtually impossible to know who else might be in the vicinity.</p>
        <p>At least 37 people have been killed since Tuesday and thousands of others wounded in Lebanon by coordinated explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies believed to have been booby-trapped by Israel. Those killed appear to largely to have been members of Hezbollah, but also include several children.</p>
        <p>“The explosions in Lebanon seem to have been targeted, but had heavy, indiscriminate collateral damages among civilians: children were killed,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said in a statement condemning the attacks.</p>
        <p>Other governments have reacted more cautiously. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Wednesday that the United States was still “gathering the facts” about the blasts.</p>
        <p>The legal debate is complicated by the fact that while Hezbollah has blamed the Israelis for the attacks and American officials and many international experts say they are responsible, Israel itself has not publicly claimed responsibility.</p>
        <p>Volker Türk, the U.N.’s high commissioner for human rights, on Wednesday called for an investigation, saying the people behind the attacks could not have known who might be holding the devices when they exploded.</p>
        <p>A 9-year-old girl, Fatima Abdullah, was killed on Tuesday when she picked up a pager that was beeping on her kitchen table to take it to her father, the girl’s aunt said. A second child was also killed, Lebanon’s health minister said on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>“Simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, without knowledge of who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack violates international human rights law,” Mr. Türk said in a statement.</p>
        <p>In practice, no one is likely to be prosecuted under international law, given the secretive nature of the operation and the long history of covert actions in the Middle East — many ascribed to Israel — whose perpetrators have escaped accountability.</p>
        <p>That has not hindered a lively debate.</p>
        <p>Some experts on the law of armed conflict, or international humanitarian law, argue that Mr. Türk’s analysis overlooks the fact that the laws of war apply in this situation.</p>
        <p>“Human rights are always present but are superseded in this case by the very specific laws intended for armed conflict,” Gary Solis, a retired Marine and Marine judge advocate who ran West Point’s law of war program. He is the author of “The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War.”</p>
        <p>Although it may seem callous, Mr. Solis said, the reality is that international humanitarian law attempts to minimize civilian harm in war but allows for “collateral damage.”</p>
        <p>The first question, he said, is whether the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel constitutes an armed conflict. He contends that it does, based  on continual exchanges of fire between the two over the past 11 months.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Solis also noted that analyzing these incidents is “like walking through a thick forest and trying to push aside a bunch of brambles” to answer questions that depend on specifics that are not known.</p>
        <p>The key questions surrounding the legality of the attacks mainly relate to civilian harm.</p>
        <p>Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group research institute and a former State Department legal adviser, said several factors could determine whether the attacks had violated the law of armed conflict or international humanitarian law.</p>
        <p>In a post on the Just Security blog, Mr. Finucane wrote that among the factors were whether the carriers of the pagers were the intended targets and whether they were legal targets. Other considerations are whether the expected harm to civilians was excessive in relation to the military advantage, he said, and whether feasible precautions were taken to protect civilians from harm.</p>
        <p>“Did this action constitute an indiscriminate attack or a series of such attacks?” Mr. Finucane wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solis, who is critical of Israel’s conduct of the war in the Gaza Strip, argued that in this case, the remote device attacks seem to be legal because the weapons did not cause “superfluous damage” or “unnecessary suffering” — both legal terms — and  appeared designed to target individual Hezbollah operatives.</p>
        <p>“Were they lawful targets?” asked Mr. Solis. “Probably, based on what we know. But we’re operating in the land of shadows.”</p>
        <p>He noted, too, that the legality of booby traps may depend on how they were made.</p>
        <p>“In World War II, we’d booby trap binoculars,” Mr. Solis said. “The Nazis would pick them up and they’d explode.” But it would have been illegal to build a factory that manufactured booby-trapped binoculars, he said.</p>
        <p>It is a fine distinction but a critical one. “A combatant may booby-trap a camera which is in fact a camera, but he may not manufacture booby traps that appear to be cameras,” he said.</p>
        <p>Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., defended the legality of the attacks against Hezbollah, saying they were a “classic act of sabotage.” To argue otherwise, he said in a social media post, would also call into question acts of sabotage against the Nazis, said Mr. Kontorovich, who is Israeli.</p>
        <p>Human Rights Watch questioned the legality of the attacks.</p>
        <p>“The use of an explosive device whose exact location could not be reliably known would be unlawfully indiscriminate, using a means of attack that could not be directed at a specific military target and as a result would strike military targets and civilians without distinction,” the group said in a statement.</p>
        <p>There are other concerns.</p>
        <p>There is widespread fear in Lebanon that, beyond pagers and walky-talkies, other devices may be rigged. Instilling this kind of fear also raises legal questions, some experts said.</p>
        <p>“Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited,” Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, a fellow in human rights at the London School of Economics, wrote on social media.</p>
        <p>The Israeli military just said it has been striking intensively in southern Lebanon over the past two hours. Since the afternoon, Israeli warplanes have hit 100 rocket launchers — some of which were ready to fire imminently — and other military targets in Lebanon, the military said in a statement.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Israeli military ordered residents of some towns and cities in northern Israel to remain close to fortified shelters. The Israeli authorities normally make this order when they believe there could soon be rocket fire from Lebanon.</p>
        <h2>Study Reveals Bird-Migration Mystery</h2>
        <p>By outfitting blackbirds with heart-rate monitors, scientists debunked a long-held assumption about the benefits of spending the winter in warm climates.</p>
        <p>For migrating birds, fall brings difficulty and danger. To reach warm winter climes, many birds must fly hundreds or thousands of miles, expend immense amounts of energy and successfully dodge storms, skyscrapers and other potential threats.</p>
        <p>Still, scientists have long assumed that a basic trade-off made migration worth the gamble: Once birds arrived at their wintering grounds, they wouldn’t need to work so hard to stay warm, saving substantial amounts of energy. “But nobody ever tested this,” said Nils Linek, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany.</p>
        <p>Now, Dr. Linek and his colleagues have done so. Their findings, based on a partially migratory population of German blackbirds, challenge the conventional wisdom. Even in the depths of winter, blackbirds basking in balmy southern Europe or northern Africa did not spend any less energy than those riding out the cold in Germany, the scientists found.</p>

        <p>Now, Dr. Linek and his colleagues have done so. Their findings, based on a partially migratory population of German blackbirds, challenge the conventional wisdom. Even in the depths of winter, blackbirds basking in balmy southern Europe or northern Africa did not spend any less energy than those riding out the cold in Germany, the scientists found.</p>
        <p>“It’s sort of shocking that there isn’t this net benefit,” said Scott Yanco, an animal ecologist at the University of Michigan and an author of the paper. (Dr. Yanco conducted the research while at Yale University.)</p>
        <p>The study, which was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution on Wednesday, also revealed that the migrants began preparing for their fall journeys several weeks in advance, saving up energy for the flight by slowing their metabolism at night.</p>
        <p>Together, the results suggest that migration is “way more complex than all the theories predicted,” Dr. Linek said. “There were a lot of surprises.”</p>
        <p>The researchers studied common blackbirds that spend their summers in the forests of southern Germany. Most of the birds stay put for the winter, but about a quarter of them migrate, flying south in October and November. These migrants spend the winter in southern Europe or northern Africa, returning to Germany by early April.</p>
        <p>Until recently, it would have been exceedingly difficult to track the energy expenditures of these small, wild birds throughout the entirety of their migratory cycle. But tiny, implantable data loggers now make that possible. “It’s basically like birds wearing fitness smartwatches,” Dr. Linek said.</p>
        <p>These devices recorded each bird’s body temperature and heart rate every 30 minutes over the course of roughly nine months, from September through May. Heart rate is a well-known proxy for energy expenditure; the more energy a bird is using, the higher its heart rate. The scientists implanted the data loggers in 118 blackbirds and were ultimately able to recapture 83 of those birds to download the resulting data.</p>
        <p>The data confirmed that the migration process itself, a journey averaging roughly 500 miles, required the birds to expend extra energy. And it suggested that the migrants began saving up for this cost in advance. Four weeks before departing Germany, the migrants began lowering their nighttime heart rate. About a week and a half later, their overnight body temperatures dropped, too.</p>
        <p>“It looks like they’re turning down their thermostat,” Dr. Linek said.</p>
        <p>These physiological shifts, which did not occur in the resident birds, helped the migrants conserve energy before their southward flights.</p>
        <p>But during the winter, the migrants did not have lower heart rates than those that remained in frigid Germany. And over the course of the entire migratory cycle, both groups of birds ended up expending the same amount of energy, the scientists found.</p>
        <p>The warmer weather did come with benefits. Using computational modeling, the researchers calculated how much energy it would be needed for each bird to maintain its body temperature given the local weather conditions. The migrants maintained slightly higher body temperatures than the German residents throughout the winter — and they expended a lot less energy doing so.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the winter, the researchers found, a blackbird that remained in Germany needed to spend an extra 18,600 kilojoules — the equivalent of roughly 4,400 calories — just trying to stay warm. That’s a significant difference for a bird that weighs just a few ounces, Dr. Yanco said. “But then in the heart rates, it doesn’t show up,” he added.</p>
        <p>That means that whatever energy the migrants were saving on thermoregulation was being spent on something else. “We don’t totally know where that energy is going,” Dr. Yanco said. “That’s sort of the next big mystery to solve.”</p>
        <p>The journey itself cannot account for all that energy, but there could be other “hidden costs” associated with migration, Dr. Linek said. For instance, maybe migrants spending the winter in unfamiliar territory must be extra vigilant about threats.</p>
        <p>Another possibility, still speculative, is that migrants can invest that extra energy in some other process, such as reproduction. That might allow migrants to produce slightly bigger eggs or provide more parental care, giving them a selective advantage even without any net energy savings.</p>
        <p>Although many questions remain, new technologies, like the miniature data loggers, are presenting scientists with opportunities to ask and answer questions that were once inconceivable, Dr. Yanco said. “The rapid advance in what we’re able to measure on free living animals is exponential, year over year,” he said. “We’re really in this exciting discovery phase.”</p>
        <h2>Why Can’t Kamala Harris Just Say This?</h2>
        <p>There’s sustained criticism that Vice President Kamala Harris hasn’t provided detailed answers to questions about changes in her positions. Why can’t candidates own that kind of transformation? What would be wrong, in Harris’s case, with saying something like this?</p>
        <p>It’s true that I once sang a softer, more permissive tune about the U.S. border, even raising my hand, along with other Democrats, during that frequently mentioned 2020 primary debate when we were asked if we would decriminalize illegal crossings. Unlike another presidential candidate I needn’t name, I’m not going to fictionalize history.</p>
        <p>But I also don’t feel bound by my own.</p>
        <p>None of us should, because we’re always learning and always growing, or at least we should be: That’s a sign of humility, curiosity, openness. Show me someone who believes and says the exact same things about the world that she did 20 or 10 or even five years ago and I’ll show you someone who hasn’t been properly living in it.</p>
        <p>I spoke of banning fracking, but I know more now. That’s why I don’t speak of it any longer. When I did, my political experience was confined largely to California, whose residents had been my primary obligation, and that state’s energy, industrial and environmental profiles differ from the country’s.</p>
        <p>But as vice president, I’ve looked at all of America, through the eyes of all of its residents, and that has afforded me a panoramic education and view. I better understand the disruption that an imminent end to fracking would cause. I better understand the enormous national asset of an array of energy sources. I have adapted and adjusted accordingly.</p>
        <p>Why do so many vice presidents run for president? Sure, it’s because we’ve been eyeing and ogling that gilded station up close and, in most cases, we had designs on it before we settled for first runner-up. But it’s also because our proximity to power has given us an extraordinary trove of information, an unrivaled exposure to expertise and a privileged series of lessons. We’re better prepared than we once were — we’re smarter. And smarter means we’ve revisited many of our past assumptions. How could it be any other way?</p>
        <p>In many senses, I’m the same person I was when I became a prosecutor and then a district attorney and then the attorney general of California and then a U.S. senator and now the vice president. There’s no rewriting or erasing how my mother brought me up — to work hard, fight for justice and respect everyone. There’s no reconfiguring the shape and bigness of my heart. That’s what I mean when I say that my values haven’t changed. I’ve taken and will always take the positions that, in my best judgment, are as fair as they can be to the largest number of people while also being as sensitive as possible to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable among us.</p>
        <p>But my judgment is no more fixed than our circumstances, which are ever in flux, and my comprehension of them, which is ever more refined. I revise it in accordance with where we are, what we need at that moment and my increasingly mature assessment of what we can hope to accomplish. So I’m a different person, too — enlarged by accruing experiences, additional insights, fresh epiphanies.</p>
        <p>You can be cynical and call that rudderless. Or you can be generous and call it dynamic. Flipping and flopping are fluidity by other names.</p>
        <p>I don’t know when we became so obsessed with “gotcha” revelations of a politician’s swerves, and I don’t know why we cast them as character defects. They aren’t, not necessarily. And to any reasonable voter, they should matter less than a politician’s truthfulness, empathy and efforts to unite Americans. Judge me on those scores.</p>
        <p>Judge my opponent that way, too. Ask yourselves which of us is living in a realm of facts. Which is being more careful not to incite Americans to fear and hatred of one another. And — you bet — which is spreading more joy.</p>
        <p>By all means, consider our constancy. But consider it in the present: Which of us seems more emotionally stable? Which delivers the same message on Tuesday as on Saturday and to one group of voters as to another? Are the positions and intentions that we’re articulating now clear and sensible?</p>
        <p>I think that matters more than a timeline of my remarks about private health insurance.</p>
        <p>I’m not some Marxist in hiding. I’m not some moderate come lately. I’m a work in earnest progress. And I hope never to see the day when I can no longer say that.</p>
        <p>For the Love of Sentences</p>
        <p>In The New Yorker, Daniel Immerwahr revisited the “obliviousness” of former President Ronald Reagan — who trafficked in the big picture and pretty images and words — to the details of scandals in his administration: “Holding Reagan accountable felt like a category error, like trying to convict a squirrel of trespassing.” (Thanks to Nancy Chek of Silver Spring, Md., for nominating this.)</p>
        <p>In an article in The Atlantic about how the comedian and podcaster Joe Rogan helped to create a distinctive “manosphere” in Texas’ capital city, Helen Lewis observed: “Austin is at the nexus of a Venn diagram of ‘has culture,’ ‘has gun ranges,’ ‘has low taxes’ and ‘has kombucha.’” (Cathy Osborne, Cincinnati)</p>
        <p>Also in The Atlantic, Russell Moore responded to the threats against immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, after Republicans promoted the fiction that they were eating pets: “When we are willing to see children terrorized rather than stop telling lies about their families, we should step back, forget about our dogs and cats for a moment, and ask who abducted our consciences.” (Doug Hjelmstad, Gothenburg, Neb.)</p>
        <p>In The Baltimore Sun, Dan Rodricks quipped: “Donald Trump saying he won’t debate Kamala Harris a second time is like the Thanksgiving turkey saying he won’t be available for Christmas dinner.” (Barbara Sale, Baltimore)</p>
        <p>In The Washington Post, Ron Charles alluded to Trump’s pet-eating peeve while drawing attention to the former president’s separate denunciation of Mark Esper, who served as the secretary of the Army during the Trump administration: “Amid the sprawling smorgasbord of deceit, it was just an appetizer — like, say, a Chihuahua — but it bears scrutiny.” (John Jacoby, Cambridge, Mass.)</p>
        <p>Also in The Post, Kimberly Harrington weighed in on the actress Gillian Anderson’s new book, “Want,” which invited women to write to Anderson anonymously about their sexual fantasies: “Of course, there are some expected classics — threesomes, group sex, being watched — but I bet you weren’t expecting a sex robot. Or an alien with curious and talented tentacles. I know I wasn’t. It would be easy to feel uncomfortable, perhaps even laugh, but instead the inclusion of letters like these makes clear that the joy and freedom in indulging one’s sexual imagination is that no one else can yuck your yum.” (Paula Mackey, St. Paul, Minn.)</p>
        <p>In The Times, Dwight Garner reviewed the short story collection “Rejection,” by Tony Tulathimutte: “This book is so cold and lonely you could hang meat in it.” (Michael Gardner, Charlotte, N.C., and Rick Treitman, Lexington, Mass.)</p>
        <p>Also in The Times, Dan Barry digested the disappearance of liverwurst, which he’ll miss despite its complicated appeal: “We all hold on to things that return us to where we came from, back to a place centered more in time than in geography. A certain doll, a certain television show, a certain snack — they are the lifesavers we cling to as the riptide of the years pulls us farther and farther from familiar shores.” (Joe Hornbaker, Covington, Ky., and Sarah Dinsmore, Wiscasset, Maine, among others)</p>
        <p>And Bret Stephens urged his conversation partner, Gail Collins, to be discerning with her concerns: “Only your finest whine — Châteauneuf-du-Kvetch.” (Mary Beth Coonan, St. Paul, Minn., and Conrad Macina, Landing, N.J., among others)</p>
        <p>Finally, in The Dispatch, Kevin D. Williamson used a Spanish term for a kind of military dictator to describe the 45th — and maybe 47th — American president: “Trump is a would-be caudillo, but his cowardice has largely spared us having to fight him, because he prefers to hide behind lawyers and then, after his lawyers get laughed out of court, to rage about the judges from the safe remove of social media. He is the Walter Mitty of Augusto Pinochets.” (Meg Grove, St. Paul, Minn.)</p>
        <p>I was equally fond of Williamson’s words in another Dispatch article, titled “The Anti-Americanism of Donald Trump”: “Trump is a funny kind of patriot. He loves America — except for the cities, the people who live in the cities, about half of the states, the universities, professional sports leagues, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Wall Street, the legal system, immigrants, the culture.” Williamson went on to note that “Trump’s enemies are all Americans, his friends are all foreign dictators, and his money lives in Dubai and Indonesia. Some nationalist.”</p>

        <p>What I’m Reading, Watching and Listening To</p>
        <p>“As life gets faster, we have become more impatient about everything,” Christine Rosen wrote in an essay in The Free Press last week that occupies a familiar genre — the one that rues our waning capacities for stillness, for discipline and for deferring gratification — but fills it with fresh examples and gives it a felicitous new nomenclature, present in the title: “The Lost Art of Waiting.”</p>
        <p>The latest M. Night Shyamalan movie, “Trap,” which began streaming for a rental fee on Amazon Prime and Apple TV+ several weeks ago, is frequently nonsensical and utterly indulgent, so I’m not exactly recommending it. The sluggishly paced first half squanders so much time on the concert performance of an R&B singer who just so happens to be played by Shyamalan’s budding musician daughter, Saleka, that the movie can seem like the grandest, gaudiest paternal favor ever. But if you can forgive a surfeit of dross for a nugget of gold, Josh Hartnett’s Jekyll-Hyde lead performance as a suburban father with a serial-killer alter ego is mesmerizing and revelatory: Who knew that Hartnett — made famous by heartthrob roles decades ago, in his early 20s — had such acting chops? His performance is one of those, like Toni Collette’s in the 2018 horror movie “Hereditary,” that’d be contending for awards if it were in a different project.</p>
        <p>Two new — well, to me — songs I’ve been enjoying: “Hey Cowboy,” by Devon Cole, released two years ago, a come-hither pop ditty in chaps and spurs, and “I Don’t Live Here Anymore,” by the War on Drugs, a 2021 song that creates a whole lush soundscape and harbors an extra special treat. Those female voices that chime in during the choruses? When I found the song’s official video, I discovered that they belonged to the two women who front Lucius, a band whose live concerts I’ve attended and adored. Lucius and the War on Drugs happen to be touring right now with the National.</p>
        <p>On a Personal (by Which I Mean Regan) Note</p>
        <p>There are dogs who can’t wait to run free. Then there are dogs who can’t bear to run far.</p>
        <p>Regan belongs to the latter group.</p>
        <p>Don’t get me wrong: She itches for and visibly relishes the stretches of our walks when we’re in the woods, she’s released from her leash and she can dart this way and that, toward a sound or a squirrel or something else that piques her curiosity.</p>
        <p>But always, she boomerangs back. She doesn’t like to lose her bearings, and I’m her bearings. She doesn’t want to shirk her responsibility, and I’m that, too.</p>
        <p>I’m guessing her thinking, obviously. I’m surely anthropomorphizing, too. But what’s the point of pets (do not say pâté — we’re moving on from last week’s debate) without a heavy dose of anthropomorphism? Besides, there are clues to Regan’s reflections, such as what she does whenever she reaches a fork in the trail before I do. She proceeds only a few strides in one of the two possible directions before she freezes, looks backward and gets a “yes” or “no” from me. While she may simply be subordinating her desires to mine, it’s also possible that she’s making sure she doesn’t wind up alone.</p>
        <p>Or that I’m not abandoned. She’s a herding dog, I suppose — one half of her is Australian shepherd and there’s a dab of Old English sheepdog in the rest — and perhaps that casts me in the role of flock. I’ve definitely noticed, on those occasions when she accompanies a group of people on a long woodland walk or hike, that she’s unusually alert to and unsettled by a straggler or stragglers. She seems intent on our sticking together, in a tight knot.</p>
        <p>I believe that boils down to disposition as much as duty. She appreciates the balm and the benefit — to her, to us — of company. The world, after all, is a big and scary place. It’s best navigated with loved ones by your side.</p>
