Day 1 of unemployment for being terminated for having a baby.

As some of you may have seen through Luccia Cafiero, I was just terminated from my position as a Full Stack Web Developer. 

I feel compelled to share my experience surrounding parental bonding leave after the birth of my son—a time that should have been filled with joy but instead became a struggle due to what I believe was retaliation for taking my legally entitled leave.

After taking the first 30 days of my leave, I was forced to return to work despite being entitled to more time. During this period, I was tasked with training my replacement (I even told my manager it felt like I was being pushed out), all while being reassured that I didn’t have a target on my back. But the daily changes in how I was treated by upper management made it clear that something had shifted.

Once I completed my remaining 60 days of leave, I was terminated just two weeks after returning. The excuse given was “not enough work for you,” but I think my overloaded coworker and a packed backlog would disagree. The signs were there—my name didn’t even come up in our sprint last Thursday. I even joked to my wife that I was being "Milton'd" (a nod to Office Space) when I didn’t receive a paycheck for the first few days I was back. When I asked about it, my manager told me not to reach out to payroll! My leave had been referred to as a “kerfuffle,” and the company’s actions reinforced the feeling that I was being punished for using my legal right to time off.

Now, I’m ready for a new chapter. I’m actively seeking opportunities where my contributions are valued, and where work-life balance is truly respected. If anyone knows of web development roles, particularly working with TypeScript, I’d love to connect and explore new opportunities.
