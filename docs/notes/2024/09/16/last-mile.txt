How Do I Survive the Last Mile to Retirement?

I have a crushing workload and the anger to prove it. With less than two years before I can leave, how do I avoid alienating everyone?

The Busywork Is Beyond

    I have worked for a large health care organization for over 25 years and am less than two years away from retirement. By staying until my full retirement age, I will benefit from a great pension and lifelong health care benefits.

    While I still enjoy the work, I have gotten increasingly sour on the extra corporate projects we are required to participate in. My workday is so packed with patient care, I often have to do these extra tasks on my own time. I fluctuate between passive-aggressively doing the bare minimum and unloading my harshest criticism. I have told my managers how frustrated I am. While they sympathize, they aren’t in a great position to fix this problem.

    I feel like I am powerless to make any effective change. But I also hate how bitter I have become about my job. I am counting my days until retirement. I recognize that the only control I have is over my own attitude. Any advice on how to survive my remaining time at work?

“I recognize that the only control I have is over my own attitude.” This is wise, and true, but it isn’t the whole story. For one thing, you also have control of your actions, and you seem to have some understanding about the manner in which your attitude is directed at others around you. And not for the better.
