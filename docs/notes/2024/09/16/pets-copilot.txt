Trump Has Crossed a Truly Unacceptable Line
Sept. 14, 2024

By Lydia Polgreen
Opinion Columnist
When my family moved back to the United States from East Africa in the mid-1980s, one might have thought it was a peak time of compassion for people suffering in faraway places. A glittering group of music superstars had recorded “We Are the World,” a smash hit charity single to raise money and awareness for the victims of a brutal famine that had gripped my mother’s home country, Ethiopia.
But when I told my new grade school classmates of my origins, I was met with cruel taunts. I was awfully fat for an Ethiopian, one said with a snigger. Must be nice to be able to have access to so much food, another joked. At the time, this was puzzling and upsetting — I had moved from Kenya, not Ethiopia, to my father’s home state, Minnesota. But the facts didn’t matter. These unkind remarks did the job the bullies hoped they would: They made me feel like an alien, an unwelcome stranger.
We live in even crueler times now, with humanitarian catastrophes unfolding on several continents, but the response of the wealthy world has been to demand tighter borders and higher fences. There is no blockbuster charity single raising money for starving refugees from the civil war raging in Sudan. And now, the cruel taunts come not just from schoolyard bullies and cranks on the political fringes, but from the lips of a man who stood on the presidential debate stage on Tuesday, a former president who once again has a coin-flip shot at regaining the most powerful office in the world.
And so I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised by that lowest of moments at the debate, when Donald Trump repeated a vile, baseless claim that Haitian immigrants were killing and eating household pets in Springfield, Ohio. This allegation appears to stem from viral social media posts and statements at public meetings. It was picked up by some of the most rancid figures at the fringe of the MAGA-verse, then quickly hopscotched from there to a social media post by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, and finally to the debate stage, sputtered by Trump himself.
There is a temptation to treat this as yet another Trump rant, a disgusting lie about immigrants like the ones he uttered as he began his presidential bid in 2015, describing migrants crossing the border with Mexico as rapists and criminals. He’s done it time and again since. He is the master of exaggerated and fabricated claims against the boogeymen, a skill he has used for decades to polarize public opinion and raise his profile and power at the expense of others.
But there is something particularly insidious about this claim, uttered at this time, from that stage. Food and pets are, to use a Freudian term, highly overdetermined symbols in our political life. They are capable of receiving and holding a multiplicity of very potent meanings, transmitting deep messages about identity and belonging.
What you eat is an instant way to communicate the most basic forms of human connection. There’s a reason American political rituals cluster around cookouts, clambakes and fish fries. The human need for sustenance — food and water to feed the physical body — is universal. But what is also universal is the meaning food carries. Everyone has a personal version of Proust’s madeleines, a food that immediately and ineffably names who you are, where you come from, the culture that made you. Food is a powerful signifier, of both belonging and exclusion.
Relishing the native foods of different states is a staple of the campaign trail. Doing it right — Tim Walz knowing what a Nebraskan Runza is — comes off as wholesome. Doing it wrong — eating pizza with a fork — earns derision. Liking the wrong things — Barack Obama’s complaint about the price of arugula at Whole Foods comes to mind — signals being out of touch with “ordinary Americans,” whatever that means.
Meanwhile, pets, in politics and in life, are the ultimate humanizer. Richard Nixon invoked his family’s cocker spaniel, Checkers, in his famous speech aimed at beating corruption allegations and saving his bid for the vice presidency in 1952. Presidential pets become celebrities in their own right, from Franklin Roosevelt’s beloved Fala to Bill Clinton’s loyal chocolate lab, Buddy, who seemed to be his only friend in the brutal days of his investigation and ultimate impeachment.
Even relatively mild mistreatment of a pet is political poison: Mitt Romney was widely mocked for admitting that he had taken his family dog, an Irish Setter named Seamus, on a 12-hour family road trip in a crate lashed to the roof of the car. It reinforced the notion that Romney, a very wealthy former management consultant, was cold and unfeeling. And don’t get me started on Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, who seems to have tanked her chances of being named Trump’s running mate by admitting in a memoir that she had shot her dog Cricket in a gravel pit because, among other sins, the dog annoyed her on a hunt.
And so it cannot be an accident that these resonances have been fused in an allegation against Haitians, a people who have long stood in for a kind of universal other in America — a completely racialized symbol of dark, chaotic forces that must be held at bay by the forces of white civilization.
There is a long and grim tradition of demonizing Haitians in the United States, one that cannot be separated from Haiti’s heroic history. It became the first Black republic in 1804 after its enslaved peoples rose up to expel the European colonists who had put them in chains. Their success so shook the United States, a nation dependent on slavery for its wealth, that the American government embarked on a ruthless campaign of isolation and manipulation of the young nation of Haiti. The legacies of those policies have lingered to the present.
Indeed, even as it has offered temporary protection to some Haitians who have fled the extraordinary violence currently plaguing Haiti, the Biden administration has continued the long, bipartisan American tradition of deep hostility toward Haitians seeking safety from violence and starvation: It has deported at least 20,000 Haitians since 2021 despite the bloody, politically motivated gang warfare that has engulfed the country. In 2021, videos emerged of border agents on horseback menacing many of the thousands of Haitians at the U.S.-Mexico border, pelting them with epithets. This wild new fiction, combining foodways with pets, seems almost precision engineered to dehumanize Haitians.
You can tell how powerful this type of slur is by how quickly and vociferously it has animated so many on the right. Figures who flirt with the mainstream have eagerly jumped into the fray. The conservative culture warrior Christopher Rufo has offered a $5,000 bounty for anyone who can find proof that a Haitian immigrant had in fact eaten a cat. It is not hard to imagine how this could quickly escalate into vigilante violence against Haitians in America. On Thursday, city officials in Springfield, most of whom have pushed back against the false allegations, said they had received bomb threats, prompting the evacuation of city buildings.
Over the past few weeks, as the euphoria of replacing the oldest ever presumptive nominee for the presidency with a younger and more vigorous candidate has worn off, I’ve realized that something about the strategy of calling Trump weird has never quite sat right with me. Yes, he cuts a comical figure, with his blotchy orange complexion, his vertiginously cantilevered hairdo, his goofy dances, his bizarre obsession with Hannibal Lecter. It has also been a welcome path to sidestepping the tiresome debates over what it means to “normalize” Trump rather than treat him as a wild aberration in American politics, something that has become harder to justify given that he won the presidency and could quite possibly win it again in November.
But the past few days have convinced me that as much as we might want to laugh in the face of his absurdity, Trump is not weird. He is far more sinister and dangerous than that. And disbelieving laughter could, I fear, blind us to moments when truly unacceptable lines are crossed.
Kamala Harris seemed to sense this in the debate. When asked in an interview with CNN about Trump’s questioning of her Black identity, she was widely praised for shrugging it off as an irrelevant question and refusing to make her candidacy about identity. But when she was asked about it again on the debate stage, I was glad that she took a different tack. She did not speak about herself; instead she used the question to highlight Trump’s decades-long history of vile racism, from his discrimination against Black tenants in his apartment buildings to his demonization of the Central Park Five.
Trump may be diminished. But in his elevation of something akin to blood libel against a group of blameless legal immigrants who came to America from their strife-torn nation in search of a better life through hard work, like so many immigrants to our shores before them, he has proved himself a dangerous and malevolent figure whose menace must be confronted and defeated, fully and frontally, in this election.

Contrast Trump and Vance's response to this story, with that of Mike DeWine, an old-school Republican and the current governor of Ohio.

DeWine has pledged $2.5 million dollars to the city of Springfield to expand primary health care in Clark County and to assist the local school districts.  He's assigned more State Highway Patrolmen to assist the local police manage traffic.   DeWine is also offering free driver's education to Haitian immigrants in Springfield. (In Ohio, drivers education is only required for underage drivers.   If you are over 18, all you need to get a driver's license is to pass the written and behind-the-wheel tests.  Offering driver's education to adults is a great idea.)   He's also called on the Federal government to provide more resources to communities experiencing a large influx of immigrants.  That's how an effective leader behaves - identifying a problem, and seeking effective ways to address it.

In contrast, JD Vance, one of our US Senators, has done NOTHING to help Springfield. Thanks to Vance's promotion of this ridiculous rumor, Springfield's elementary schools are receiving bomb threats. Trump's only proposal -- to round up and deport Haitian immigrants - is of dubious value to Springfield, and completely ignores the fact that these are LEGAL immigrants. 
Vance and Trump  have no interest in helping the people of Springfield.

MAGA is a wrecking ball.  It doesn't solve anything and it doesn't help anyone.

When I heard him say in the debate, "They are eating the dogs", I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the statement. Who could possibly believe something so ridiculous? Now I fear that he will turn it into a powerful rallying cry for his supporters.

We can't possibly let this man into the White House again.

Brava!  I'm glad you have taken on the entire xenophobia and fight against "The Great Replacement".

So here you have Haitians who came over legally due to chaos in their country, and as hard workers, have helped little Springfield, Ohio keep up their manufacturing.   And a candidate for President no less is concocting a vicious smear about eating pets.

It sounds lunatic but it's intentional, because those that spout these lies know they are inciting others to provoke violence via bomb threats and school closures.

"Forgive them because they know not what they do", said Jesus.   He wouldn't be able to say the same about Trump and Vance.

As someone married to a man of Chinese descent, I find it interesting that I have not heard too many sound bites about the fact that not only is this accusation egregious, it’s been launched at Asian people for as long as I’ve been alive. My own brother made a joke about losing a cat to the Chinese restaurant down the street at a Christmas party in front of my Chinese Mother in law. 

Not that it wasn’t offensive on its face that caused me to get up from my seat get my kids and say we are leaving right now, while my mother tried to convince me that he didn’t mean anything by it. I later apologized to my mother in law. Her response broke my heart. She said it’s okay I’m used to it. I no longer have contact with him. That was already well on its way but that cinched it for me. 

It’s absolutely meant to dehumanize and mock someone who looks and sounds different from you. Everyone should be disgusted.

While so many of us are focusing on the "dogs and cats" comment (and yes, we did and love our dog so much), too few of us are focusing on the dehumanization that is at play here. For a nation that prides itself on "liberty and justice for all," we have also allowed "othering" to take hold since our founding.  I feel it as a gay man, and certainly my husband does (even more) as a brown man with an accent, who came to this country in 1992 to start his medical residency and serve the health needs of his fellow citizens ever since. The cruelty in JD Vance's initial comments and the exploiting them by Donald is on full display.  And beyond memes, we're still hearing a lot of silence. From people with a loud voice. This is not a political issue per se; it is an issue of human dignity.  And I wish that corporate executives would stop running away from DEI and particularly LGBTQ+ equality, but also talk about what's at stake when we target people in live and work alongside us in our cities and towns just because of how they look. Or where they are from.  The silence here is deafening.

"Trump has crossed a truly unacceptable line."

Unacceptable--to whom?

To decent people, he crossed into "truly unacceptable" territory years ago when he mocked a disabled reporter, when he was caught boasting about grabbing women's genitals, when he cozied up to dictators and insulted our allies, when he incited a violent insurrection . . . 

To the MAGA faithful, there is literally no line he can cross that they would consider unacceptable. He acknowledged that himself with his infamous, "I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?"

That's where we are today, with a large cohort of Americans who will accept any behavior at all from their cult leader.

Hillary Clinton was pilloried mercilessly for using the d-word about Trump's mindless followers. Today, that's looking like a pretty apt description.

I too have a problem with Haitians.  My next door neighbors are Haitian.  The husband is a chief nursing officer and his wife is an administrative nurse.  They're the sweetest people you could imagine.  The problem is their granddaughters who are 4 and 6 years old.  When they visit they love to play catch me if you can with my Bernadoodle.  My dog loves to herd them.  The problem is that they try to share their snacks with her.  I caught one of them trying to give her part of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  You have to watch these Haitians.  They won't eat your dogs, but they will feed them.

Trump is a pyromaniac. Setting rhetorical fires, with no regard for human consequences. He's now inflamed the Haitian community so he could further divide America. Consequently, people are at risk - and Trump is fully responsible, although he will claim otherwise.

Mature adults are accountable for their actions. Trump is a very troubled individual in a position to gain awesome power. 

It is incumbent on US to put out the fire.

My wife is Haitian, I’m Jewish. We know a blood libel when we see it, and with the way people regard their pets nowadays as members of their families, that’s exactly what this.  And no less was the accusation that supporting a woman’s right to choose meant baby’s could be killed after they are born.

It was heartening to see the moderators call out both as disgusting lies during the debate.

The inescapable fact is that the racism  baked into the American system and population as one adjunct of the global  Western colonial Nakba -- has always been the secret sauce that keeps Americans voting and acting against their own common interests, and in support of the ravenous oligarchy that actually owns the place.

When "liberal" president Clinton signed  the job-destroying NAFTA agreement -- with all the former presidential employees of  the owners flanking him -- he set the stage for the deindustrialization of the country that harmed tens of millions.

Their anger has been widely  directed away from the actual political perps and toward Mexicans, aliens, immigrants and especially people with  dark skin. Crime -- greatly exaggerated-- is pictured as the inevitable acting-out of black and brown  people -- rather than the poverty and desolation resulting from the ever-widening inequality that the capitalist "order" creates.

Only something far more effective than the forced de-Nazification of Germany can cure this: the educational system, politcal structure and business practices need to be radically reshaped to erase this deadly, terminal disease. 

We need the kind of government that will do that, once and for all. It will be the work of decades but must be undertaken.

"This time he has really gone too far" has been said so many times that it became a joke on SNL 6 or 7 years ago.  The fact is that there is no bottom.  There are no consequences for the man with unlimited legal resources and the power to control the political futures of everyone in the cult that  used to be a major political party.  Half of our fellow citizens actually are deplorable.  And liberal democracy was an 18th Century ideal for which human nature is not fit.  We can hope to escape this time,  Maybe.

I used to overhear these libels when I'd have a bite to eat after a round of golf at the various clubs I've played at over the years. At the time, I thought to myself that these guys would be mortified if their comments were recorded and played back for their own families or put on the TV for everyone to hear. 

But something has changed in our country in the past decade and now these kinds of words ricochet around the Internet daily and Trump and J.D. seem to be the masters when it comes to the libel of humans who haven't been as fortunate as they.

I just wonder what kind of dehumanization is coming from these guys next and whether anyone will do anything about it. I know where it went in Germany in the 1930's and pray we don't go there.

This vicious rumor is not only an offense against Haitians -- the equivalent of yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater -- it's a harm against the entire community in that it is encouraging people to blindly accept rumors rather than fact-checking them.

The thing is, the claim is so outrageous that the only thing many people will remember from the debate is Trump saying Haitians are kidnapping & eating people's pets. And too many will then think, "It might be rubbish, but who really knows for sure right? Better safe than sorry and only Trump's promising to do something about it." That's how he won last time, and it looks like that's how he will win again. Most other countries, a traitor who tried to overthrow a legitimate election by having his followers storm the nation's legislative & political centre to try and stage a coup would be rotting in jail. In the USA? Well, just look at Trump, not only has he faced no consequences, but he's even running for a second go!

I'm sorry the author had to endure such idiotic behavior. 

Racism is a political staple in the USA; has been since 1619.

Lee Atwater, father of GOP's "Southern Strategy" summed it up in this short video: https://tinyurl.com/y8jvv2cy

It has played out in various ways over the years. Notably, in 1988, it came across our TV as the Willie Horton ads where the GOP's opponent was governor in a state that let Horton out of prison on a furlough program from which he fled and then raped a woman.

These days Trump and the MAGA GOP portray immigrants in the same light as Willie Horton, criminals and rapists. Immigrants, per se, are not a "protected class" so Trump goes after them with the same vengeance he went after the Central Park Five. It works.

Nothing new under the sun. Racism, the same old song . . .

I was scrolling Facebook this morning. Someone mentioned the Orange One’s comments about this topic.  Interestingly, the person said they went to Springfield, OH to show support for the Haitian immigrants; stating there must be Haitian restaurants, and they were going to show their support by enjoying a meal with their family.  There were many comments, ALL showing a version of support, up to, “Great idea!  I’m going too”.  Absolutely heartwarming!

Trump’s legacy will be the exposing of deep seated racism in our country. We no longer have legalized slavery, but we still have much work to do. All of us must speak up!

Trump is dehumanizing immigrants before mass deportations and we can expect mass vigilante violence that will go unchecked. It’s 1860.

Trump has crossed the unacceptable line many times.  For those of us who live in NYC, we've observed this for decades.  I cannot grasp, how of all possible people, he was the one to succeed in catapulting himself from political obscurity to the Oval Office and on the way capturing a cult following which did not reap any benefit from his administration,  but feels as if it has. None of the policies implemented by his administration (his policy entourage) were intended to improve the lives of the middle class or the poor. Just the opposite. Next time around, were he to win, it will be much worse.  I guess his MAGA following will only wake up when it loses its Social Security and Medicare coverage.  Let's hope the Harris/Walz ticket prevails.

I completely agree that "weird" is not the most accurate term for Trump,  Vance, and the MAGA-afflicted cult. Sinister is much better; evil has been debatable I suppose but sinister is spot on.

Granted "weird" has had good effect, but I wholeheartedly concur with the need to ratchet it up where it belongs.

The fact that 47% of the US electorate is ok with sinister is truly alarming and sad...no, tragic.

I know that it should be obvious that that's what you mean, but so many things that should be obvious -- like Trump's unfitness for any political office, let alone the presidency -- seem to escape a large percentage of the public these days.

The real story here isn't Donald J. Trump. There is NOTHING about his personal narcissism, ignorance, and inability to stop lying that isn't known. The real story is the 40% plus of Americans who provide an estimate of Lincoln's categorization of people who can be fooled all of the time, and why this has come to pass. It isn't stupidity--JD Vance isn't stupid, even if he is almost as perverted as Trump. It isn't ignorance--al of those Evangelical supporters are in his camp even knowing that he is more the Antichrist than a Christian. It is at least in some part fear that white or male privilege is going away, although few of the MAGAlomaniacs are conversant with the term. I wish there were a solution to this kind of problem.  Maybe it takes a catastrophic defeat, as happened in WW2 Germany and Japan to wake a populace up, although the lessons there seem to be fading after a few generations.  As for the rest of us, we just have to be rational and realize the existential threat requires us to put aside any reservations we have and vote for the only realistic alternative to DJT.  So I am 100% committed to Harris/Walz and the fact that I am very comfortable being so does not really matter.

As reported by ABC:
"A new round of bomb threats have targeted three medical facilities and an unspecified fourth facility in Springfield, Ohio, on Saturday, officials said.

The facilities have been swept and cleared, with some already reopened, a police official told ABC News.

Springfield Regional Medical Center, Ohio Valley Surgical Hospital and Kettering Health Springfield were listed by authorities as targets.

The Springfield Police Division has beefed up its staffing as it deals with threats stemming from unsubstantiated claims about the Haitian migrant community.

Two elementary schools were evacuated and a middle school was closed on Friday in the wake of a threat sent via email in Springfield, according to the school district and the mayor."

I wonder how many residents of Springfield will recognize that Trump is the ONLY reason this is happening. 

This is exactly what happened on Jan. 6.

The same charge of recent immigrants killing and eating their neighbors pet dogs and cats emerged in Southern California in the 1970s, when South Vietnamese, who had fled the Communist takeover of their country, often in dangerously overcrowded fishing boats, began making their way through resettlement camps and into local communities.  Perhaps it's no coincidence that the rumors came out of conservative, solidly Republican Orange County.

Based on the Extreme Court’s ruling in Trump’s immunity case, Biden could have Trump arrested and put in jail. There would be no legal repercussions, as arresting and jailing a person guilty of domestic terrorism would be within his purview as President.

Trump's demonizing of the Haitian immigrants with this bizarre claim is something I cannot laugh at as I have extended family in Haiti who I am supporting. They are living in hell and have lost their homes as gangs took over and torched whole neighborhoods, grief stricken by random, brutal murders of two brothers and a sister dying horrible slow death from gangrene because the hospitals were closed. I could not help them. There is no escape for the average Haitian as the gangs have sealed off the cities. Most Haitian immigrants are actually devout, hardworking Christians and cannot comprehend all the hatred - but they are also survivors who are used to enduring conditions that are unimaginable to the average American.

>>>deep seated racism in our country. 

It's been awhile since I travelled widely in the US. But in those days - 1970s and 1980s - in small town America - I was conscious of racism, and 'fear' of outsiders.

In some small towns I was told to move on by the police. In one place a police man in a squad car watched me leave the town's limits in the early AM.

Mind you, in other places policemen were helpful to me. One gave me a lift out of East St. Louis 'You're not safe here', and another loaded my bike into his police car and drove me across the Chesapeake Bay bridge.

I guess what I'm saying is that in terms of racism Trump's just an updated Wallace.

I grew up in the 70s when I got in fights with students at my high school in a small farming town in Illinois when they celebrated the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., exposing the powerful undercurrent of racism all around me.

Trump is a walking talking object lesson testifying to the plain truth that you don’t have to wear a white hood or use the N word to be racist. His anti Haitian slander was not simply bizarre but vile. 

Trump has inflamed and encouraged the racists and white nationalists among us by disguising and normalizing racism in the MAGA universe as an antidote to “wokeness” as if that were a poison.

I find it deeply disturbing that we now have to worry about the prospect of a dangerous race baiter becoming president because of the undemocratic electoral college, itself a relic of the dead weight of slavery in our political body,

The Obama Birther Myth was the clarion call that Trump promoted in 2015 to gather his base to his side, where they are guaranteed never to leave. 

The Birther Myth (and Trump has admitted that it was a useful lie) was pointed at the neo-confederacy, those people who believed that the Lost Cause of the Confederacy was a righteous fight. 

The Southern Baptist church was founded in 1845 to protect slavery from Abolitionists in the South, and extend slavery to the n ew states of the American West. When the Confederacy lost the war, they hid themselves under the skirts of the 'Old Time Religion' and then proceeded to promote the Lost Cause as a fight for states rights and Jim Crow segregation.

All of the forgoing is still underway, and we saw it again on Tuesday night from Trump, and repeated on Fox news.

In virtually any other functioning democracy Trump would not be a legitimate candidate, the GOP same as a party. They are an aspect of the failure of the American political process, its justice system and its attendant media, including the NYT. They are where they are today because of an unreported and unchallenged systemic breakdown and a refusal by the media to stand for the truth without equivocation. As a result, the Fox News, NRA, Evangelical Church, Putin, Koch and Federalist project has managed to patch together all that is weak and regressive about the USA into coalition of opportunism, greed, resentment and delusion, creating useful fools by the million. Trump and the GOP's attempt to murder the truth, purge the public service, attack whole swathes of the population, mainly women, and terrorise millions of innocent people because of their immigration status is positively Soviet in its scope and virulence.

You will also never hear that nationwide, violent crime was higher and rising during the Trump years while lower and declining since.

Meaning that comparatively, Harris is not the dangerous one.

Trump also talks about starting a third World War.

But he is so ignorant of history that he doesn’t realize how such wars actually start: by powerful people spreading hateful, vicious lies about minority groups.

Ezra Klein hosted a social researcher on his podcast recently.  The research focuses his work on the motivations behind violent uprising, such as January 6.  He recently concluded research interviewing most of the 900 or so convicted demonstrators who attacked the Capitol on that fateful day.  What he disclosed amazed me:

1.  Less than 10% of the participants were from militia groups, such as the Proud Boys;

2.  Many of the participants were well educated professionals from both rural and urban areas; and,

3.  The prime motivation for the attack was based on racism - and the fear that Whites were losing hegemony in our growing multi-cultural country.

Racial animus is the fuel which propels Donald Trump and the Far Right, and will continue to do so.  And President Biden, for all his many successes and compassion, has not adequately responded during his tenure to stem the tide of immigration, nor has the Democratic Party sufficiently factored into its strategy the plain fact that half of America sees rising multiculturalism as a dilution of White hegemony.  Sad but true.

Legal immigration is necessary and should be encouraged.  But governments around the world are facing immigration woes for political and climactic reasons as humans flee unsafe places.  Failure to adequately stem this is how Republican craziness has overtaken rationality.

The message today is fear, hate, torment and expel immigrants. The fact that the stories are fantastical, even deranged, doesn't make much of a difference to MAGA.

Much as I appreciate your essay, I'm afraid it is not just Trump and the ultraconservatives.

We have an ongoing genocide in Palestine that is underwritten by U.S. dollars and arms and enabled by U.S. diplomatic coercion.  And the entire democratic leadership has contributed to the utter dehumanization of Palestinian lives.

It's way past time for democrats to stop pretending that we are morally superior, by spinning the fantasy that there are degrees of evil.

When your campaign has nothing to run on you have to create controversy to keep your base happy. So the best he can do is pick on a defenseless immigrant minority, just like the bully in a schoolyard. 

This speaks volumes on the character of the candidate who has a long history of using and abusing immigrants and minorities both politically and personally. 

While these diversions have worked in the past, ie Willie Horton, I’m hopeful that a majority of Americans see through this ruse and vote against him.

Blood libel is exactly the right term, especially when you consider JD Vance accusing a Haitian immigrant of "murder" in the accidental death of a child. They are truly a dangerous pair.

He finally crossed the line?  That ship had sailed years ago.  Nothing Trump does should surprise us any more.

Sadly and frighteningly, Trump has crossed one truly unacceptable line after another. There is no depth to which he is unwilling to sink. There is no tactic too vile, too ugly, too hateful, too dishonest, too immoral for him to refrain from using. 

Haitians in Springfield and Venezuelans in Aurora are feeling the impact of it, Someone is going to get killed. And Trump will celebrate it by doubling down yet again.

No one leaves their homeland when it is secure, prosperous and lif is good. My family and I, plus many others, left Czechoslovakia to escape communism. We had the good fortune to come to America as immigrants, but my parent's hearts were always in their homeland. I was a child, but that culture is part of my heritage.
Trump is the epitome of evil and intentional ignorance. To him we also say "never again".

There's little to argue with in this opinion, except to note that the "truly unacceptable" line crossing is awfully personal to this writer.  There have been countless opinions offered on countless Trumpian offenses that were beyond the pale.  That anyone in 2024 is only just now seeing a line crossed and deeming THIS one the bridge too far is staggering and unutterably depressing to me.  Why do so many Americans shrug at the outrages until the consequences come home for them personally?

Trump crossed into "truly unacceptable" territory decades ago. Even if you only count what he has said or done since becoming a political candidate, he cross that line at least 8 years ago.  This is just the latest specific community to be targeted (e.g. Neimoller quote).  Hopefully the Haitian American community will take its rage to the polls and not just vote for Harris but also vote against every single Republican on their respective tickets, because they are all enablers.

Trump crossed an unacceptable line when he started promoting the idea that Obama was born somewhere other than Honolulu.

Completely agree. I would add he’s crossed way too many lines.

It was reported that after the debate, he stepped out into the spin room and was immediately surrounded by 100 or so reporters. As long as he gets an audience he will continue to peddle vile and dangerous lies. 

It’s his trade and it keeps his base charged.

I'm happy to see that commentators--Both Polgreen and Brooks--are going beyond the initial analysis of the debates, where virtually everyone focused on how Harris had "bated" Trump, and pointing out now that she more importantly  accuse him directly of complete moral failure.

Harris is the first person to basically say to him, "Have you no decency? Have you no shame whatsoever?"--something I've been waiting someone to say directly to trump's face for eight years.

American Indians aside, everyone in the US is an immigrant or an immigrant's descendant.  Donald Trump could be an exception because he might not be human.  How else can we explain the contempt he has for his ancestors?

I do my best not to insult people. I try to respect their opinions when I disagree. 

I have crossed a line, too.

It has become too difficult to accept or respect some of the people who plan to vote for trump.
It’s one thing to like his policies and plans. I disagree but if that’s the reason for the choice, it’s valid.

At the same time, anybody who believes the stories of pet eating, thousands of murders committed by immigrants, or who goes along with his assaults on women, LGBTQ Americans, People of Color, his acceptance of conspiracy theorists, falls into my category of ignorant or even stupid.

WAKE UP PEOPLE! Vote!
