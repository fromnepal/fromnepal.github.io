Typhoon Ampil barreled toward Japan on Thursday packing strong winds and heavy rain, and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and trains in and around Tokyo.

The powerful storm had maximum sustained winds of 104 miles per hour, equivalent to those of a Category 2 hurricane, on Thursday evening, according to the U.S. Navy’s Joint Typhoon Warning Center. By Friday, Ampil’s winds were expected to strengthen to 138 m.p.h., similar in strength to a Category 4 hurricane.
