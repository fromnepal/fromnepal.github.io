A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck off the east coast of Taiwan on Thursday, the United States Geological Survey said.
The earthquake hit at 5:06 p.m. local time at a depth of seven miles, the U.S.G.S. said. Its epicenter was about 25 miles south of the seat of Yilan County, on the island’s northeastern coast. Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration said the earthquake had a magnitude of 5.7.
Taiwan’s fire department said that the earthquake had not immediately caused any major damage. It reminded the public to beware of landslides in mountainous areas.
The tremor could be felt in Taipei, the capital. The quake struck close to the epicenter of a much stronger, 7.4-magnitude earthquake that killed 17 people in April.
Taiwan’s earthquake preparedness has strengthened over the past few decades in response to destructive quakes.
