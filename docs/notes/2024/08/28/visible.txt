NEW YORK - In response to Mint Mobile’s recent promotional campaign, Visible, a leading prepaid wireless provider on Verizon’s award-winning network and recently ranked #1 by J.D. Power for best purchase experience in its segment— is offering T-Mobile postpaid customers a 5-year rate guarantee at $15 per month, per line.

Yesterday, Mint Mobile announced that if AT&T and Verizon customers switch to Mint Mobile, they can buy one three-month plan for $45 (not exactly the $15 a month they advertise) and get up to four additional lines at no cost (not counting the added taxes and fees). However, this offer is only valid for the first three months, after which all lines will roll over to the retail price of $40.

“While Mint is promoting this short-term deal that won’t last, we want to give people looking for a better deal ongoing savings, service and value with no hidden fees, period,” said Nancy Clark, President of Verizon Value.”

Read the fine print: While Mint Mobile, a subsidiary of T-Mobile, claims it is offering you $15 a month with free lines, it is not very free if after the three month promotional period a customer is charged $600 for 5 lines, plus taxes and fees. If you read the fine print, by month four, you'll be charged $120 per line if you sign up for their "unlimited" plan (which by the way, is actually a 40 GB data plan that then slows down).

Calling all T-Mobile postpaid single line customers ready for a switch to something better (and cheaper): Visible is now offering T-Mobile single line customers the chance to bring their T-Mobile number and get a Visible plan for $15 per month (taxes and fees included, not extra) with a 5-year price guarantee.

Even at the standard rates, Visible can still beat this short term offer from Mint. “Unlimited” on Mint is $30/mo per line plus taxes & fees, with a three month minimum commitment, whereas actual Unlimited on Visible is $25/mo per line, taxes & fees included, with no commitment required.

With Visible, you’re truly getting more for less - and for a long time! The savings keep piling up. Unlike our friends at Mint, taxes and fees are included on Visible’s plans. PLUS, you don’t have to pay up front for 3, 6, or 12 months at a time, and T-Mobile switchers will pay the same $15/month each month for five years with Visible.

To activate this (actually) amazing offer, bring your own device,use code BYEBYETMO at visible.com, and port-in your T-Mobile postpaid number within 30 days.

what happens after five gb on mint vs visible?

Here's what happens after you use up your 5 GB of data on Mint Mobile and Visible:

### Mint Mobile
- **Data Throttling**: After you use up your 5 GB of high-speed data, Mint Mobile will throttle your data speeds to 128 kbps¹². This speed is quite slow and may make it difficult to perform data-intensive tasks like streaming videos or loading large web pages. Basic functions like sending texts and making calls will still work, but internet usage will be significantly limited.

### Visible
- **Data Throttling**: On the $15 plan, after you use up your 5 GB of data, Visible will also throttle your data speeds. The exact throttled speed isn't specified, but it will be slower than the high-speed data you initially get⁴⁵. However, you will still have unlimited data, talk, text, and hotspot, just at reduced speeds.

In summary, both Mint Mobile and Visible throttle your data speeds after you exceed the 5 GB limit, but they do not cut off your data entirely. The throttled speeds are generally sufficient for basic tasks but not for high-bandwidth activities.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
