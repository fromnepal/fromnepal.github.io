        <h1>Faced With the Boeing Starliner’s Flaws, NASA Gets a Couple of Things Right</h1>

        <p>Odysseus may lay claim to the most delayed and perilous trip back home, but the NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore
            and Suni Williams are giving him a run for his money. What was supposed to be a weeklong mission to the
            International Space Station will now be an eight-month stay in space, after the spacecraft they launched
            aboard, the Boeing Starliner, experienced some unexpected glitches.</p>
        <p>Boeing has been utterly humiliated by the Starliner’s failure, not least because the company’s rival, SpaceX,
            will take Wilmore and Williams home. But it’s NASA that deserves applause: Faced with an unsettling turn of
            events for its human spaceflight program, the agency has gotten a couple of things right.</p>
        <p>It got the first thing right nearly a decade ago. In September 2014, NASA awarded contracts to both SpaceX
            and Boeing for their commercial crew programs, effectively saying it would pay two companies to develop new
            spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts to and from the space station. The veteran aerospace firm Boeing
            was awarded $4.2 billion, while the newcomer SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion.</p>
        <p>While both companies’ programs were mired in delays, SpaceX eventually vaulted ahead of Boeing and pulled off
            a successful crewed flight to space in 2020. Boeing remained sluggish. Throughout this period, NASA
            emphasized that the whole reason it gave contracts to two companies in the first place was in case one
            company hit snags. The wisdom of that choice is on full display now, as Wilmore and Williams can return home
            on a SpaceX mission, after the Boeing mission went awry. Redundancy paid off.</p>
        <p>NASA got one other thing right during this debacle. Though Wilmore and Williams are trapped in space until
            February, the agency is wisely playing it safe. There isn’t much reason to think the Starliner couldn’t
            securely bring the astronauts back to Earth. But NASA is choosing not to risk a repeat of the tragic
            Challenger and Columbia disasters. Taking risks is a fundamental part of spaceflight, but the United States
            is no longer in a race to beat the Soviets. NASA can and should take its time to reduce the odds of risk
            whenever possible. It’s the right thing to do.</p>
        <p>The astronauts’ delayed return must be truly aggravating for both of them and their families. But it’s
            unquestionably preferable to an alternative outcome that would put them both in any sort of elevated danger.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>The article titled "Faced With the Boeing Starliner’s Flaws, NASA Gets a Couple of Things Right"
                discusses the challenges faced by NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams during their mission
                to the International Space Station (ISS). Initially planned as a weeklong mission, it has now extended
                to an eight-month stay due to unexpected glitches with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft.</p>
            <p>Boeing's failure with the Starliner has been a significant setback, especially since SpaceX, Boeing's
                rival, will now be responsible for bringing the astronauts back to Earth. Despite this, NASA is praised
                for its decision-making. Nearly a decade ago, in September 2014, NASA awarded contracts to both SpaceX
                and Boeing to develop new spacecraft for ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS. This redundancy was
                intended to ensure that if one company faced issues, the other could step in, which is precisely what
                happened.</p>
            <p>SpaceX successfully conducted a crewed flight to space in 2020, while Boeing lagged behind. NASA's
                foresight in awarding contracts to two companies has paid off, as Wilmore and Williams can return home
                on a SpaceX mission after the Boeing mission encountered problems.</p>
            <p>Additionally, NASA is commended for prioritizing safety. Although the Starliner might be capable of
                safely returning the astronauts to Earth, NASA is avoiding any risks reminiscent of the Challenger and
                Columbia disasters. The agency is taking its time to minimize risks, which is deemed the right approach.
            </p>
            <p>While the extended mission is undoubtedly frustrating for the astronauts and their families, it is
                considered a safer alternative to any scenario that might put them in greater danger.</p>
