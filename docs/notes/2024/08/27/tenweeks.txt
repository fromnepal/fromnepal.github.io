The Election Is in 10 Weeks. These 3 Things About the Polls Keep Me Up at Night.

Sunday night was an unexpectedly exciting time in the Anderson household: Just after dinnertime, my husband got called and asked to participate in an election poll. I was in the middle of getting my toddler ready for bed when he rushed into the room, holding our baby in one hand and his phone in the other, now on speaker so I could hear the questions.

There’s a real thrill you get as a pollster when you get to peek behind the curtain and see how someone else in your field is asking voters what they think. But it was also a reminder of how messy social science can be. Here was my husband, telling this very nice interviewer what he thought about, among other things, immigration and Tim Walz, all while pacing the hallway bouncing a bedtime-bound infant. I can only imagine what others are up to while answering survey questions.

As we near Election Day, Americans’ interest in polls will only increase. Election forecasting models are being heavily scrutinized and debated by commentators and reporters. Small shifts in polling results can trigger big headlines. As we start this post-Democratic convention week, when analysts will be combing for any hint of a bump for Kamala Harris, it’s worth keeping in mind that there are lots of things that make polling art as much as science.
