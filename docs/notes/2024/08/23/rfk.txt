Election Live Updates: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Suspends Campaign and Endorses Trump

Mr. Kennedy announced that he was pausing his troubled independent presidential bid during a news conference in Arizona, where Donald J. Trump will also host an event this evening. After accepting the Democratic nomination, Kamala Harris is looking to an intensive new phase of the race.

Here’s the latest on the presidential race.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his independent presidential campaign and endorsed Donald J. Trump on Friday, the latest shift in a fast-evolving 2024 campaign.  

Mr. Trump, campaigning in Las Vegas, gushed about the endorsement. “That’s big,” he said, but in talking to reporters after the event, he declined to say if he would offer Mr. Kennedy a role in his administration if he is elected in November. Mr. Trump is heading to a rally in Glendale, Ariz., later Friday and would be joined by a “special guest,” his campaign said.

Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris campaign, suggested in a statement that Kennedy supporters should turn to Ms. Harris. “For any American out there who is tired of Donald Trump and looking for a new way forward, ours is a campaign for you,” said the statement, which did not refer to Mr. Kennedy by name.

Mr. Kennedy’s withdrawal is not expected to affect the race substantially; polls have diverged on whether he pulled more potential voters from Mr. Trump or Ms. Harris.

His announcement came the morning after Vice President Kamala Harris closed her often jubilant nominating convention in Chicago with a sober-minded address that sought to establish her as uniquely qualified to lead and unify the country — and paint her opponent as divisive and dangerous.

After weeks with the political spotlight nearly all to herself, Ms. Harris is moving into an intensive new phase of the campaign against Mr. Trump, the fiercest combatant in American politics.

The Harris campaign has not announced her first post-convention campaign appearance. Nor has it announced when she will hold her first press briefing since Mr. Biden’s withdrawal from the race, even as Mr. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, jab at her lack of engagement with reporters.

But preparations are already underway for what will be the next major marker in the campaign, a Sept. 10 Harris-Trump debate on ABC.

Here’s what else to know:

    Trump appears to mend fences in Georgia: Mr. Trump appeared to set aside years of animosity between himself and Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, at least momentarily, after the governor spoke out in support of the former president’s candidacy. Just three weeks after the former president called Mr. Kemp a “bad guy” who was hurting his efforts to win in Georgia, Mr. Trump told Fox News on Thursday: “I think we’re going to have a very good relationship with Brian Kemp.”

    A candidate with a platform: Mr. Trump is the first presidential candidate to have his own social media platform, Truth Social, which he used to provide real-time commentary during Ms. Harris’s convention speech. As she laced into him, he wrote in one post, in all capital letters, “Is she talking about me?” and then went into a posting storm against her and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Afterward, he went to another reliable platform, calling into Fox News with instant reaction.

    The Harris campaign’s pushback: Ms. Harris used a considerable portion of her Thursday night address to talk about her upbringing as the daughter of a father from Jamaica and a mother from India. Casting her mixed heritage as uniquely American, she appeared to be trying in part to inoculate herself from attacks by Mr. Trump, who made his political rise by questioning the citizenship of the first Black candidate to rise to the top of Democratic politics, Barack Obama. Ms. Harris will also have another means through which to promote her story: television ads, for which her campaign already plans to spend $370 million.

Abe Hamadeh, a former prosecutor and a Republican nominee for Congress in Arizona, is speaking at the Trump rally. He secured the nomination recently in a bitter primary in which he mainly faced off against Blake Masters, the party's former nominee for Senate in the state. Notably, both Masters and Hamadeh earned Trump’s endorsement. Hamadeh is delivering fiery remarks in which he has pledged to crack down on crime at the border. And he’s getting a hometown welcome at the rally in Glendale, which is in the district he is running to represent.

Heap won a primary race last month against Stephen Richer, a Republican who defended the integrity of the county’s elections in 2022 and faced significant criticism and personal attacks from Kari Lake and her supporters. They claimed without evidence that Richer had helped to rig the election against Lake. Heap has refused to say whether Arizona elections are fair, but says he is running “to secure” them.

Democrats featured a litany of prominent Arizona politicians at their convention in Chicago this week. At Donald Trump’s rally today in Glendale, Ariz., Republicans are offering a rebuttal of sorts, rolling out a long list of speakers ahead of the former president’s appearance, including Representatives Andy Biggs, Eli Crane and Paul Gosar, and Kari Lake, the U.S. Senate nominee and close Trump ally.

It was perhaps the biggest speech of Kamala Harris’s life, the first time a Black or South Asian American woman would accept the Democratic nomination for president.

She had come to the stage at the United Center on Chicago’s West Side with an opportunity to share her story and vision with millions of Americans.

The crowd roared as the vice president’s entrance song, Beyoncé’s forceful “Freedom,” coursed through the building.

Ms. Harris, eschewing suffragette white in favor of a dark suit, beamed as she took in the scene: cheering delegates waving long blue signs bearing her name.

In the first row below the rostrum, Ms. Harris’s excited great-nieces Amara, 8, and Leela, 6, held up handmade signs.

As Ms. Harris began her speech, Amara peered up at the vice president. In a small buffer zone behind the girl, a photographer for The New York Times took a picture that captured the power of the moment. It quickly went viral.

Kennedy’s decision to suspend his campaign is unlikely to significantly change the nature of the race. Even if all Republicans or independents who supported Kennedy now switch to supporting Trump, Trump would only gain an average of 1 percentage point across swing states, according to our polling.

Democrats had spent months seeking to tie Kennedy to Trump, but have more lately backed off as Kennedy's polling weakened.

Campaign-finance records show that Kennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, was refunded $925,000 from the Kennedy campaign on July 18. We didn’t learn about that refund until this week, but it’s unusual to see a self-funding candidate get money refunded to them — a move that surely foreshadowed today's announcement. Shanahan had put in $12.5 million in successive donations to back their ticket.

The Kennedy campaign will be one of the cycle’s oddest money-in-politics stories. This was a campaign that had an extraordinary reliance on a supportive super PAC, a security consultant who put millions (temporarily) into backing him, and in Shanahan, a running mate who was chosen in no small part because of her ability to financially support their bid. Kennedy faced many big challenges, like ballot access. And his campaign-finance gambits couldn’t overcome them.

I’ve written a lot about Nicole Shanahan over the last five years. It’s worth thinking about what kind of role she wants to have in politics after this. She used to be a major Democratic donor who lived a somewhat private life. Friends were shocked by her decision to join Kennedy's ticket. But she catapulted into the spotlight and seemed to relish fighting with her former party and the media. She said this week that she wanted to be a major donor in California politics going forward. So she’s probably not fading into the background and could become a persistent political figure in her own right, as a donor or a candidate.

    In my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory. So I cannot in good conscience ask my staff and volunteers to keep working their long hours, or ask my donors to keep giving when I cannot honestly tell them that I have a real path to the White House.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threw his support behind former President Donald J. Trump on Friday after suspending his troubled independent campaign for president, saying he was withdrawing his name from the ballot in battleground states.

He announced his plans in a speech in Phoenix that also castigated the mainstream media and accused the Democratic Party of “abandoning democracy” and engaging in “continued legal warfare” against him and Mr. Trump.

Campaigning in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump expressed delight about Mr. Kennedy’s decision.  “That’s big,” he said. “He’s a great guy, respected by everybody.”

Mr. Trump was expected at an Arizona rally later Friday, and his campaign had told supporters to expect a “special guest.”

Mr. Kennedy had been in behind-the-scenes talks with the Trump team for weeks about whether he would be willing to suspend his campaign and endorse the former president. Those talks were brokered in part by Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson and Omeed Malik, a businessman who has supported both candidates, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The younger Mr. Trump, in particular, was concerned that Mr. Kennedy was drawing support from his father.

Mr. Kennedy said that his decision to back the former president would be a “difficult sacrifice for my wife and children,” but that he felt compelled to help Mr. Trump over support for policy positions he holds dear, including diminishing America’s military presence overseas and an overhaul of the country’s public health system.

Mr. Kennedy’s wife, the actress Cheryl Hines, has privately expressed reservations about the possibility of him joining forces with Mr. Trump, two people familiar with Mr. Kennedy said.

Mr. Kennedy, 70, the scion of a Democratic political dynasty, ran one of the more unconventional and persistent third-party bids in modern American political history, combining populist economic rhetoric, isolationist foreign policy leanings and government skepticism. He found a base of support among Kennedy-curious independent voters and disaffected Democrats and Republicans.

He began his presidential campaign last year as a Democrat, seeking to challenge President Biden for the nomination. But when he found his path there blocked — which he blamed on the Democratic Party — he embarked on an independent campaign that unnerved both major parties, as allies of both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump feared he could siphon support from their candidate.

Five of Mr. Kennedy’s siblings released a statement on Instagram on Friday afternoon, saying that his decision to endorse Mr. Trump “is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear.” His siblings, who have publicly disavowed his campaign since last year, concluded their statement: “It is a sad ending to a sad story.”

Despite a common narrative in recent days that Mr. Kennedy’s continued presence in the race was pulling support from Mr. Trump, a New York Times analysis found that was not consistently true. In some recent high-quality polls, he was found to be drawing more votes from Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.

Ms. Harris’s campaign in a statement Friday afternoon encouraged supporters of Mr. Kennedy to instead support her. “Even if we do not agree on every issue, Kamala Harris knows there is more that unites us than divides us: respect for our rights, public safety, protecting our freedoms, and opportunity for all,” the statement said.

In recent months, Mr. Kennedy’s campaign had become almost singularly focused on ballot access: As an independent presidential candidate, he had to get on each state’s ballot separately, which required hundreds of thousands of signatures and tens of millions of dollars.

The effort was largely bankrolled by his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley investor who was once married to Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, and whose arrival on the ticket in late March brought an immediate and much-needed cash infusion. To date, she has put more than $14 million into the campaign, campaign finance records show.

Through the spring and summer, as Mr. Kennedy began to get on state ballots, his poll numbers, once in the double digits, began to soften — a trend that is often seen among third-party and independent candidates as the general election approaches. By the end of August, polls put him at around 5 percent nationwide. And his campaign was running out of money, campaign finance filings showed.

An environmental lawyer, Mr. Kennedy has become better known over the past two decades as a prominent opponent of vaccine mandates, promoting widely refuted claims that childhood vaccinations cause autism and railing against what he called the “corporate capture” of the federal government by pharmaceutical companies.

On the campaign trail, he opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine, supported Israel’s war in Gaza and argued for sealing the southern border. He changed his position on abortion several times, ultimately landing on restrictions tied to fetal viability.

He eagerly claimed the mantle of his family legacy, often talking about his father, Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle John F. Kennedy, even as his own family members disavowed his candidacy.

In his speech on Friday, Mr. Kennedy implied that Mr. Trump had offered him a role in his second administration, dealing with health care and food and drug policy. “We’re going to reform the entire food system,” he said.

Mr. Kennedy spent much of the speech detailing his concerns about the high rates of chronic diseases in America, a constant theme of his campaign, which he blames on environmental factors, prescription medications and processed food. He cast himself as a freedom fighter against a broken democratic process and as a public health advocate.

“Many months ago, I promised the American people that I would withdraw from the race if I became a spoiler,” Kennedy said, adding that he believed in battleground states he would be a spoiler specifically for Trump, enabling a Democratic victory. A win by the party he feels betrayed by — the main focus of his remarks today — seems to be his worst-case scenario.

Independent polling indicates that Kennedy’s support had fallen long before President Biden exited the race and Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee, and his backers are less likely to vote in November than other voters. Though he said he believes he would spoil the election for Republicans, it is unclear from polling if his campaign suspension would significantly shift the race for either major-party candidate.

On Truth Social, Donald Trump tries to refashion himself as supportive of abortion rights.

Donald J. Trump, who recently said he has “no regrets” about appointing the Supreme Court supermajority that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights, declared on social media on Friday that his administration will be “great” for women’s “reproductive rights.”

Mr. Trump’s use of the specific phrase “reproductive rights” — the language used by abortion-rights advocates — appeared to be an effort by the former president to refashion himself as essentially supportive of abortion rights and as a political moderate on an issue that has the potential to be damaging to him in November.

“My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote on Friday morning on Truth Social, his social media platform.

At the Democratic National Convention, the end of Roe — and Mr. Trump’s professed pride in appointing the justices who eliminated it — was a central focus. Women told haunting, personal stories about the dangers they faced being denied abortions after the ruling was overturned, with pregnancies that were not viable and that threatened their own health.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been at ease discussing reproductive rights on behalf of the Biden-Harris administration, talked at length in her nomination acceptance speech on Thursday night about Mr. Trump’s role in curtailing those rights. She has framed Mr. Trump as a threat to “freedoms” — reproductive freedom and the freedom of economic mobility among them.

“I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home,” Ms. Harris said. “But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let’s be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. And now he brags about it.”

She also described hearing painful stories around the country, adding, “This is what is happening in our country, because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done.”

Mr. Trump watched her speech and posted on Truth Social about it roughly 40 times, often writing in capital letters to criticize Ms. Harris’s remarks on abortion and other issues.

The Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe helped mobilize Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections, and Democrats believe it will do so again this year. Some 22 states have implemented bans on abortion at various stages of pregnancy since the end of Roe in 2022.

Mr. Trump recently told CBS News that he has “no regrets” about the Supreme Court justices he appointed who brought about the end of federal abortion protections.

Mr. Trump used to support abortion rights before declaring himself anti-abortion in 2011 when he was considering a Republican presidential campaign. He has appeared uncomfortable with how to discuss the issue of abortion ever since he officially became a Republican candidate in 2015. He ran hard to the right on the issue, trying to convince social conservatives that they could trust him. While social conservatives have applauded the end of Roe, his new language is not likely to please them.

“My advice: When you’re in a hole stop digging,” said Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council and a social conservative who wanted tougher anti-abortion language in the Republican National Committee platform. “This week made clear, the D.N.C. has the corner on the abortion market. He is not only suppressing his own support, he is going to hurt the vast majority of Republican candidates who are 100 percent pro-life.”

He struggled for months this year during the Republican presidential primaries with how to discuss the issue, privately saying he “liked” a 16-week abortion ban as he considered what ground to stake out. Ultimately, he publicly said he supports returning the issue to states to decide, but has said he wouldn’t sign a federal abortion ban.

Democrats are skeptical of that statement, and believe if he wins another term he will be guided by conservatives seeking more restrictive measures on reproductive rights.

On Thursday night, hours before using the language employed by abortion-rights activists, Mr. Trump once again falsely claimed that “everyone” wanted Roe “terminated” and brought back to the states. In reality, Democrats forcefully opposed the move and lobbied against it.

A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to an email asking for clarification on why he was staking out new ground.

Setting aside the question of endorsing Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s plans as a candidate remain somewhat inscrutable. Even as he takes steps to remove himself from the ballot in Arizona, his campaign’s lawyers in New York have asked a federal judge to prevent state officials from blocking his ballot access there. He appears to be undertaking a broader challenge there to the constitutionality of the state’s election laws.

I’m in Phoenix, where Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent presidential candidate, will soon make a speech addressing his “path forward” in the race. He just filed paperwork to withdraw from the ballot in Arizona, and he is expected to end his campaign. Kennedy has been in talks to support former President Donald Trump, who will be holding his own rally later today just miles away in Glendale, Ariz., but it remains unclear if Kennedy will endorse him.

An announcement by the Trump campaign has also fueled speculation about Kennedy’s support. An unnamed “special guest” has been scheduled to appear with Trump at his Glendale rally today.

Donald Trump this morning on Truth Social said that his administration “will be great for women and their reproductive rights.” During Harris’s speech, one of his lengthiest responses on social media was his response to her attacks over his clearing the way for the end of Roe v. Wade. After abortion rights helped boost Democrats in midterms and off-year elections, the party is trying to make the issue central to its appeal to voters this year.

Trump said earlier this year that he believed decisions on abortion should be left up to the states, and he often insists, falsely, that Democrats and Republicans alike wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, an achievement he has bragged about frequently on the trail. But Harris in her speech spoke at length about reproductive rights and sought to tie Trump to plans to limit access to birth control and crack down on abortion, putting him on the defensive.

I’m in Las Vegas, where former President Donald J. Trump is scheduled to appear at an Italian-Mexican fusion restaurant at lunchtime to promote his plan to exempt tips from federal income taxes, one mirrored by Vice President Kamala Harris, much to Trump’s chagrin. The rivals are zeroing in on service workers in Nevada, a key voting bloc in the crucial swing state.

Trump says he will have a ‘very good’ relationship with Gov. Brian Kemp after endorsement.

Donald J. Trump on Thursday appeared to set aside years of animosity between himself and Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, at least momentarily, after the governor spoke out in support of the former president’s candidacy.

“I think we’re going to have a very good relationship with Brian Kemp,” Mr. Trump said on Fox News, adding that the governor had been “very nice” in endorsing his campaign earlier in the night.

Just three weeks earlier, Mr. Trump had called Mr. Kemp a “bad guy.”

The relationship between the two men has been deeply strained after Mr. Kemp refused to join in Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election result in Georgia, where Joseph R. Biden Jr. beat Mr. Trump by less than a percentage point.

In December 2020, Mr. Trump demanded that Mr. Kemp, a fellow Republican, resign from office, saying on social media that the governor was an “obstructionist.” Mr. Trump has never given up on his false claims that he won Georgia in 2020.

In this year’s Republican presidential primary, Mr. Kemp declined to support Mr. Trump, saying that he cast a blank ballot.

And Geoff Duncan, the Republican who was serving as Georgia’s lieutenant governor in 2020, has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Mr. Duncan, who left office last year, was one in a series of Republicans who spoke out in support of Ms. Harris at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week. Mr. Duncan said he had received death threats after he pushed back against Mr. Trump’s drive to reverse the election outcome.

But Mr. Kemp has long maintained that he would support the Republican presidential nominee in this year’s general election, whoever that might be. And he made his public support for Mr. Trump plain during his own appearance on Fox News on Thursday.

“We’ve got to win from the top of the ticket on down,” Mr. Kemp told the network on the final night of the Democratic convention, arguing that a victory by Ms. Harris would be damaging for the country. “We need to send Donald Trump back to the White House.”

It was a striking shift from earlier this month, when Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Kemp was hurting his efforts to win in Georgia this year and asserted that the state had been damaged by the governor’s leadership.

“He’s a disloyal guy,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Atlanta. He repeatedly dismissed the governor as “little Brian.”

Mr. Kemp issued a statement saying that he was focused on the election in November and would not be “engaging in petty personal insults, attacking fellow Republicans, or dwelling on the past.”

“You should do the same, Mr. President,” Mr. Kemp said.

Before Mr. Trump’s loss in Georgia in 2020, a Democrat had not won a presidential election in the state since Bill Clinton carried it in 1992.

Mr. Duncan, the former lieutenant governor, said in a text message on Friday that Mr. Trump’s embrace of Mr. Kemp made sense as a matter of political calculus, and that Mr. Kemp had “earned the right to endorse whoever he wants, even if it is purely transactional in nature.”

Mr. Duncan said that it would make “zero political sense” for Mr. Trump to carry on “a fight with a popular G.O.P. governor in a battleground state.”

“The better question is why it took so long for Trump to figure it out,” he added.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to end his troubled independent presidential campaign on Friday, according to three people briefed on his plans, and has been in talks to throw his support behind former President Donald J. Trump.

Mr. Kennedy’s campaign said this week that he intended to address his “path forward” in a speech from Phoenix. Mr. Trump is expected to hold a rally later in the day in nearby Glendale, Ariz.

On Thursday, Mr. Kennedy filed paperwork to withdraw from the ballot in Arizona, a spokesman for the secretary of state’s office there said. It could not immediately be determined if the campaign was taking similar steps in other states.

But lawyers for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also filed papers in federal court in New York on Thursday seeking to block the enforcement of a court decision that disqualified Mr. Kennedy from the state’s ballot. His lawyers also now seek to broaden a federal lawsuit he filed in May about his ballot application to argue that New York’s ballot requirements are unconstitutional.

The three people briefed on Mr. Kennedy’s plans emphasized that nothing was final, and that the iconoclastic Mr. Kennedy could still change his mind, but said that plans were in the works for him to appear alongside Mr. Trump on Friday. Some people close to Mr. Kennedy were still arguing forcefully against an endorsement, according to two of the people.

Mr. Kennedy’s backing of Mr. Trump would be the culmination of weeks of discussions, brokered by high-level intermediaries, between the two men, which began in July just before the Republican National Convention.

Mr. Kennedy’s departure from the race would be the end of one of the more bizarre third-party presidential bids in modern American history, and it would remove an unpredictable element that could have tipped the outcome of the race. His endorsement of Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, would be a stunning turn for a scion of one of America’s most storied Democratic families.

Mr. Kennedy spent much of his career working as an environmental lawyer but became known in recent years for his opposition to vaccines and for his promotion of conspiracy theories and right-wing misinformation. Many members of the Kennedy family condemned his candidacy and took to the campaign trail this year to support President Biden’s re-election.

In recent weeks, as his campaign’s money ran low, Mr. Kennedy’s support in national polls, once in the low double digits, plunged to about 5 percent. It was nowhere near sufficient to have a shot at victory, but still enough to potentially affect the results of the election, depending on his numbers in key swing states.

Mr. Kennedy began running for president last year as a Democrat, challenging Mr. Biden. He later embarked instead on an independent campaign that unnerved both major parties, which feared that he would siphon critical support from their candidate.

His campaign has in recent months become focused almost singularly on the costly effort of securing ballot access in all 50 states. As of earlier this week, the campaign was on the ballot in 19 states — including the swing states of Michigan and North Carolina — and had submitted ballot access applications in more than a dozen more. Some of those applications had been challenged by the Democratic Party and its allies, leading to legal battles.

The campaign’s move to withdraw the Arizona application came less than a week after a supporter dropped off 110,000 signatures with the secretary of state’s office in Phoenix. The New York Times reported that those signatures appeared to have been provided by a pro-Kennedy super PAC that gathered the signatures last winter, an arrangement that would have exposed the campaign to legal challenges.

Indeed, on Friday, Lis Smith, a strategist for the Democratic National Committee, said the party’s lawyers had already reviewed the signatures in Arizona and found that the vast majority had been collected when the PAC was active.
