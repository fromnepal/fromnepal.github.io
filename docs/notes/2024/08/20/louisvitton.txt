AITA for telling my mom to never touch my stuff again after she lost my Luis Vuitton bagAdvice Needed (self.AITAH)

submitted 13 hours ago by Glittering-Celery323

Ok so I (15F) have always wanted a Luis Vuitton purse. I’ve always wanted something expensive as my own as all my things are hand me downs from my older sisters, as we are not the richest of people. Eventually i decided that if I wanted my purse I’d get it myself, so I god a job at a local restaurant and started to save up my money. While I worked I looked at purses and decided that I liked a little bag, it was expensive but after a few months I had the money. I quickly went and bought my bag, I didn’t even let my family touch it when I got home. I didn’t even wear it for the first week as I was too scared to damage it in anyway. One day after school I came back home and went into my room to look at my bag but went I got in it was gone from its place on my desk. I looked around my room to see if I’d moved it and just forgot but I couldn’t find it. I went out and I ask my sisters but they said that they hadn’t touched it so I went and found my mom. I asked her if she’d seen my bag and she said she’d shown it to her friend and her friend had liked it and asked if she could borrow it. My mom had said yes. I hadn’t even used it yet. So say the least I wasn’t please by this news, I blew up at my mom telling her not to touch my stuff and she said that her friend would be ok with it and I was being dramatic. I got grounded and was told to stay in my room since I was acting like a child over a bag. The next day I asked my mom about the bag and she got an uncomfortable look on her face, instantly I knew something was wrong. She wouldn’t say anything but after a while she’d finally admitted that her friend had lost the bag, and she didn’t plan on replacing it. I was furious, I exploded at her saying that she and her friends shouldn’t have touched it in the first place and to never touch my things again. I also said some other hurtful things that I don’t care to repeat. I ended up making her cry and my sisters are calling me an asshole because it was just a bag and I was being dramatic, so am I the asshole?

Absolutely ! 💯

This is something my daughter would work for, and I would totally be proud of her. Not only would I absolutely respect the fact that she paid for it, and never touch it without her permission, but I would NEVER even think about letting someone else anywhere near it !! Mom is a huge gaping asshole in this situation. OP, you have every right to be pissed off !!

Yep and anything worth more than $500 is a felony theft. OP needs to have a conversation with her mother about how that bag needs to reappear.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]EFTucker 279 points 2 hours ago 

No she needs to report it to the police honestly. Their mom is a fucking pill addict or something. My mom was too and this is 100% in character for addicts.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]lotteoddities 123 points 2 hours ago 

I really hope OP sees this exchange or someone else in the comments mentioned this. Even the smallest, least expensive LV bags are over $500. I have one of those cell phone and card wallet only Gucci bags and it was $900, a YSL one is $1,800, a LV one is also $1,800. OP needs to contact the police and report her mother for theft.

The fact that OPs siblings are calling OP the asshole makes me think Mom is highly manipulative or even abusive and they're afraid or unable to see anything their mom does as being wrong. Which is very common in addicts. It doesn't have to be pills/drugs, could be shopping, gambling, or even an addiction to stealing things. But Mom is displaying big addict behavior and needs to be held accountable for her theft.

Good luck OP. Save your money, hide it well (I’d give my money to my uncle to put into an account for me), don’t buy anything tangible, and when you’re out don’t “loan” them anything.

[–]OverturnedAppleCart3 5 points 1 hour ago 

    Yep and anything worth more than $500 is a felony theft

That's not how the law works. Since you said "felony" I'll assume you're American. In the United States alone, there are at least 51 different sets of laws defining theft (or larceny or other words meaning theft). And that's not even considering the hundreds of other countries around the world who will each have at least one set of criminal laws.

In New Jersey, the threshold for felony theft is $200. In Texas it's $2500.

In Canada, the threshold between the equivalent of a misdemeanor and the equivalent of a felony is $5000.

As a general rule of thumb, a sentence starting with an unqualified "the law is..." unless you know the exact jurisdiction you're talking about is going to be wrong.

This is the way. u/Glittering-Celery323 if you want to get the truth, pursue this option.

Your mom either sold your bag, or gave it to a friend who stole it. Go to the LV website and figure out how to get your bag's "date code". Then go file a police report for theft, and tell them what your mom told you, that you suspect it was stolen from her friend while borrowing it, and that you'd like their help checking local pawn shops. 

Then, after you file it, tell your mom. Play innocent, like you believed her and just want to get your stuff back. After all: if she told the truth, it should be all good. 

If her friend secretly stole/sold it, your mom may be upset after it comes out, but you can defend your actions: you didn't know her friend lied!

If your mom freaks out, ask her why, and press to get her to talk about what's going on. Most parents will not steal from their kids unless there are serious money issues going on. She may just be too ashamed to talk to you about it. You are probably going to want to retract the police report and tell them it was a misunderstanding of this is the case, but at least your mom will know it's better to talk to you than steal going forward.

I know lots of people here are on the "accuse your mom of theft" train, but I feel like that's pretty naive given that you are still a minor living with them for the next few years. You need to maintain a relationship with her, not go nuclear on her from the get-go.

Sounds about right. My friend in high-school was dating a girl and her mom was a degenerat gambler that took money when it was in the open.

[–]toorigged2fail 7 points 3 hours ago 

OP probably needs credit monitoring too.

Seriously OP, check your credit to see if your mom is opening accounts in your name. I would not be surprised.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]No_Juggernau7 6 points 3 hours ago 

Literally this. Depending on the cost, you could threaten to report her. But her being OP’s mom, would probably mean her getting charges pressed against her wouldnt actually be in OP’s best interests. The threat might be enough to get the mom to reimburse for the value of the item, but then again she could call the bluff if it’s that. But an expensive bag is probably felony larceny—being a 200$ bar—so the theft has some legal traction I believe. Just probably a lot more negative consequence than it’s be worth. But what a terrible excuse for a parent. If you needed a license to raise, she wouldn’t have passed.

It isn't legal, but the way to get the debt off your credit report and out of your name is to report the fraud, which will likely end up with the person who stole your identity going to prison.

Parents like this use their kids credit all the time. Parents/guardians can sign/co-sign contracts for their kids, so some particularly awful ones forge their kids names & "co-sign" on stuff for themselves. They burn through their kids' credit after they've ruined their own. OP please check your credit score (everyone starts out with a low/basic number, just have to look it up) social security #, anything regarding your identity. Something will definitely show up if your mom's used your name on anything to get your credit started without your knowledge. Rarely, actions like what she did with your purse are genuinely out of the blue. She may have thought she could get away with something like that cuz she has already been up to some shadiness behind your back. I'm so sorry you're having to deal with such a family.

[–]trazom28 11 points 9 hours ago 

Stuff like this just blows my mind. I'm a second on my kid's bank accounts for while they are off at college / always good to have a second name on it - but I couldn't tell you the balance. It's their accounts. Once in a while they ask me to do something (deposit or withdrawl) but it's not mine. It's an easy decision to treat it that way.

At 15 she should be able to spend her money on whatever she wants, because real life will be happening soon. Ideally some would be saved but let kids enjoy life. Teach them, of course, but we can't forget life is for living.

Especially if money is tight in the family and OP has been working and instead of contributing money to her family (like her mother probably expects she should) she saved up for an (albeit impractical and IMHO waste of money status purchase) overpriced brand name handbag.

Clearly my opinion is that OP made a choice to spend her money in the way a young person would, and it probably wasn’t the wisest purchase, but it’s her money and none of anyone else’s business what she does with it. No one had a right to take that away from her. And then act so nonchalant about it. Shameful.

That's not that much of a stretch actually. I'm not a bag person, but a friend of mine is and she keeps all her designer bags in the...dust bags?...they came with along with the receipt and any credential thingies. If OP was anxious enough that she couldn't even use the bag, I'd imagine she might have kept it in the store bag even (personally I'd be half-planning to return anything like that on my own for at least the first week. Even if I really wanted it, but I come from parsimonious people who hate extravagance. It's hard to shed.)

It was so treasured to her, I’m sure she kept very single piece of tissue paper that it was wrapped with, including the receipt. I keep the receipts and little authenticity cards for all of my high end purses. I’d be willing to bet if she went back to the store, they’d be able to see if it was returned because that was my first thought—Mom was looking at it, saw the receipt and total, and returned it for cash.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Sea-Still5427 91 points 10 hours ago 

I think you've got it. OP should look for the receipt and if she can't find it, go back to the store she bought it from to see if it's been returned.

If they say not, look on local marketplace platforms to see if someone's advertised it for sale.

Oooo. I think you figured it out, Holmes! Seriously, I'm 85% sure this is it. And she said the whole family isn't rich, so maybe the mom needed it for bills or something, but instead of being the adult and asking her daughter to contribute (which she sounds mature enough to definitely be okay with) she stole it instead. And that's just the better scenario. She very may well have used it for something a lot more frivolous. Having lived around a whole lot of addicts, it strikes me as being addicted like behavior.

My friend's sister bought her LV bag in Paris last November. She was informed that LV bags contain a microchip.

While it is not a GPS, OP can take whatever information she has and report the bag as stolen. If a sales associate can find OP's bag was returned, maybe she can get it back. My heart hurts for OP.

[–]Economics_Low 119 points 10 hours ago 

The wallets are more expensive than the really small bags. I think it is because they’re more intricate and take more labor to make. Still, a small new LV bag would be about $1000.

Locally, there was a reporter who went to a new, high-end restaurant to write a review and she had a large, bright red bag that she slung over the back of her chair. She was shocked that it was stolen as she was sitting right there. Don't sling your purse over your chair!! I've noticed a lot of places started putting little hooks on the edge of the tables or the bar to hang you purse so it's in front of you, making it safer.

It’s certainly possible.  One time i left my backpack under my seat at a dining establishment after dinner.  It had a laptop and enough cash in it to purchase a new car. I remembered it 5 miles down the road and went back and got it. It was locked and nobody had bothered it. I called the place and asked them to hold it, it had my work laptop in it and some papers I needed, they did, I tipped them a bit extra for it. 

But it was a plain, school kid looking backpack. 

If I had left a LV bag hanging off the back of my chair, it would probably be gone INSTANTLY.

[–]ConstructionNo9678 65 points 11 hours ago* 

I was thinking this. Her stealing/selling it isn't a bad theory, but it's far more likely that OP's mom felt that as a 15 year old, OP shouldn't be owning that kind of purse and/or that it's the family's money. Especially if they aren't rich to begin with.

If I were OP, I would go back and note down the number of hours it took to work for that bag, then show it to the sisters who are calling her an asshole. It wouldn't matter if OP spent money on makeup, a bag, or a PC. She spent her time working a job that must be around minimum wage instead of doing literally anything else, she deserves to keep her money.

Edit: to be clear, OP is NTA here. Regardless of what happened, the mom should not have touched the purse.

Except at 15, she would have to share her bank account with her mother. She could have her checks cashed at a check cashing place, but they'll take a nice chunk of her meager minimum wage paycheck.

Then she'd have to hide the money, and her mother will be searching every square inch of her room while she's at school/work, looking for her stash, as well as watching where she goes in the house when she come home on payday.

Its going to be hard to save with a thief like her mother around.

OP should count this as a revelation of the true cold-hearted, unfeeling nature of her mother’s feelings toward her. Her mother has no conscience and OP should bide her time until she can get out of that house. She has every right to never look back.

OP has been punished for making mom feel jealous, OP is the recipient of controlling, manipulative behavior which I’d guess is lifelong.

Mom’s actions are text book (personality) disordered.

And OP needs to call the cops ASAP. The non-emergency number should suffice unless Bitchy Egg Donor is threatening violence. If she is, 911.

Having a police report is ironclad when it comes to consignment shops and pawn shops. They have to make sure their merchandise is NOT stolen. If it is, they can get shut down in addition to having to pay restitution. However, just *saying* it's stolen isn't enough. If OP has a report, that's legally covering her ass and it trumps anything that Lying Thieving Egg Donor can spin.

This looks like fake engagement bait to me. Mostly because OP hasn't commented on their own thread (or anywhere else) plus it's one of those suspicious "adjective-noun-number" type accounts instead of an obvious throwaway. 

OP is welcome to disabuse me of this notion by commenting anything anywhere else but my god how many times we see this same hallmarks in this sub.

She refused to replace it but then had the audacity to come to my house with the exact same bag and smugly rubbed it in my face that she could have replaced it but didn’t want to… her and my brother broke up like a week later cuz that was his final straw with her

I remember this guy I studied with. Nicest guy ever. Hard-working and serious.

His parents forced him to take out a credit card and they started buying all sorts of crazy shit on it : installed a home theater in the basement, furnished the whole living room, bought an insane fridge, and so on.

He was the one stuck paying off the balance and the monthly fees on the card, while also paying rent at his parents'. He virtually had to have a full-time job while also studying full-time. He was actually doing pretty decent in college for someone who barely slept. And he was in a rough engineering major to boot.

Their logic was : "When you move out, you can bring all this stuff with you."

How the hell do you move out when you can't even save up. And who the hell moves for the first time into a place that can fit a home theater. With the changes in technology, by the time he left, the home theater and other electronics must have been unusable.

My point is, some parents think their children are their property and whatever they earn or own is up for the taking.

I live in a rent-controlled apartment in a high-rent area. Our building changed hands and the new owners are basically without any kind of ethics.

My neighbor has a disabling back problem, but she still works FT to support herself and her husband who is much more seriously disabled than her and maintain health insurance for both of them here in the U.S.

We live in a old building and my neighbors live in a unit that hadn’t been redone in decades, so this and that kept breaking down. Our property manager bamboozled my friends into moving in with relatives for “a few weeks,” so that it would be easier for the new owners to repair and/or upgrade multiple things at once.

Unbeknownst to my neighbors, as soon as they were out the door, the new owners packed up all their stuff—EXCEPT FOR THEIR BRAND-NEW REFRIGERATOR—and “stored” it somewhere. They then completely gutted and refurbished the place. The property manager then called my neighbors a few weeks later telling them they (and their stuff) could move back in if they signed a lease promising to pay DOUBLE the previous rent.

Fortunately, we were able to find them a good lawyer who was able to get them and their stuff back into their refurbished apartment at the same rent they’d been paying before.

But in the interim, my friend was very emphatic that she wasn’t walking away without retrieving her BRAND-NEW REFRIGERATOR, even if she ended given it away or even just taking it to a dump.

I filed a police report and was sure my ex had taken it. Two weeks ago an aunt from out of state mailed me a box my mom had given her. My mom passed away earlier this year and my aunt thought I should have whatever it was. It was my freakin jewelry! So yes, some moms steal their children's things. I actually felt bad thinking my ex had taken it.

Edit for grammar

It's shocking how many parents, and especially mothers, are jealous of their children and become hostile or straight up idiots over it.

At one point around 2010 still living with parents, I bought a car the same make and model as my moms, because they were reliable. However, mine was one year newer (early 90's for both) and the paint was more in tact. Multiple times I was met with "trade offers" where my mom tried to demand I trade her cars in exchange for her paying the insurance on the newer car I had just opened a loan on, while I'd make loan payments on my car and insurance on her car. All because she "needed" the "nicer" car more than I did.

Many years later, when I got a real career... I finally surpassed her moderate income and she found out, at a family birthday party she talked shit about how I had faked my way in to it and how I don't do any "real work" TO MY HUSBAND. He shut that conversation down so fast and talked about how loved I am at work and all the extra projects I tackle for them. How I've been promoted more than once early in my career because I put in the work to make sure I'm the best I can be at my job.

Yep when my mom divorced my dad we went with her. My brother was three years younger than me. That poor little boy, threw our whole childhood he was scapegoat, he was just like his father, we both ruined her life by existing, but he was just like his father so everything was blamed on him

But as soon as I hit puberty and started going out with my friends and having boys calling me the tables turned and he became the golden child and I was the scapegoat

It was so confusing because I would come home all excited about making a new friend and I would be talking about my new friend and how nice they were, and then when it was time for dinner I would ask her what we were having for dinner and she would seeth at me “Why don’t you ask your new friend about dinner since they’re so NICE” 

She had a baby when I was 19, she was a much better Mom to him so at least there was that, but I remember bringing a boyfriend over to meet her And when I was in the bathroom she told Him that was actually my baby. He didn’t care we weren’t planning on getting married we were just having a good time, and I guess when he didn’t react she thought she should confess so when I came out of the bathroom she acted like it was a big joke ha ha isn’t that funny. No, no it’s not.

Just so jealous. If I was excited about a new job she would be mad because she would like to have a job. If I was worried about ending up homeless she would claim she was homeless even though she had an actual apartment that was taking care of it was the weirdest thing it was like she would try to steal my trauma For attention.

I could go on but OP should read the narcissistic parents sub.  I bet she recognizes her mom

Your mom Is some kind of selfish and bizarre. And what kind of human would be like? Oh, that's your kid's purse. Can I borrow it? Like seriously, who does your mom hang out with?

Also, I would definitely tell Mom that you're going to call the police if the friend doesn't come up with the purse. Nobody loses a f****** purse in one goddamn day. For sure they stole it.

[–]Ok-Lifeguard-4614 30 points 7 hours ago 

This is the most likely scenario. Loaning someone a designer handbag doesn't make a lot of sense. My parents would steal gold, gifts,and cash anything I had of value and pawn it. They would then ground me for "losing" the items.

It didn't occur to me what was actually happening until I was in my 30's. It's insanely hard to accept someone who is supposed to love and protect you will do such heinous things. It definitely happens, though.

That is exactly what happened your mother took your bag and she sold it to her friend.

The friend supposedly lost a bag and when your mother asked her about it she said she wasn't going to replace it. No one does that you let me a bag it was expensive I lost it I have to replace it.

Hell, you can do it online in some places. Above a certain dollar value or in certain categories, you may have to go in person. It will likely vary by state/department, but it should be fairly easy either way. I had to go through the process because something of mine got stolen, and it was pretty straightforward.

Then, with that report, see if you can get a claim filed with your mom's homeowners/renters insurance. Mom will probably fight that, though, and depending on the deductible, it may not end up being worth the claim. My deductible was about $100 less than the item itself, so it wasn't worth the pain. But if you find otherwise, push for it.

[–]SeemedReasonableThen 4 points 8 hours ago 

While I 100% agree that either mom or friend stole the bag, police report is a waste of time.

You have no proof of theft, nothing that will stand up in court. OP is a minor under control of a parent, and even though OP paid for the bag herself, mom is likely able to sell or dispose of the bag if she wishes (check your local laws, but unemancipated minors don't have a lot of rights)

NTA

Either your mom stole it and sold it or pawned it, or her friend did.

A grown woman don't just lose a handbag. Especially not a brand new one that she just "borrowed" from a friend. That is the weakest story I ever heard.

Your mom should absolutely buy you a new one..brand new please, with reciept and certificate.

If she does not, you will need to file a police report and claim it on your parent's home insurance. Surely the home insurance has the "clumsiness" addition? The one that covers the glasses if you drop them and the chrystal wineglasses if you bang them while washing up? "Just lost the purse, dunno how" might fall under this category. But you will need a police report.

Former insurance agent here. That's not really a thing. You can "schedule" specific items on your homeowners or renters insurance so there's coverage on that specific item if it's damaged, stolen, etc. but that doesn't cover loss caused by an occupant. The odds of OPs bag being covered on the policy at all aren't great since most homeowner policies have built in limits for how much they'll cover for certain items. Unless the bag was scheduled, even if there was a fire, it wouldn't necessarily get complete reimbursement.

Furthermore, the mom would have to make the insurance claim since she would be the named insured on the policy and I seriously doubt she's going to do anything that might blow back on her friend at this point.

I 100% agree with filing a police report, but this is going to be more of a small claims court issue than an insurance claim.

My parents weren't on drugs but opened credit cards in my name and ran up a bill. Fortunately they always paid more than the minimum on time, so it never hurt my credit score. They were in the process of going through bankruptcy and that was just another way for them to get by (despite having decent incomes, they were failing).

Skip to a few months ago (20 years later). Our relationship is good, and my dad asked if I wanted to go in with them and buy a cabin as a family. They now have their shit squared away and have retired and I'm doing very well for myself. It wouldn't be a stretch at all to buy a cabin. But I told him there is no way that I'd ever let our money meet. I've forgiven them, but I'll never forget and let them risk my finances.

I would like to add: at 15 people need to have an increasing level of privacy and their property must be respected. It's not ok to let anyone get your stuff without your consent, much less from your own room/closet/box. The mother grounded OP because she is an absolute POS.

👉 Reinforcing: OP, go to the police. Don't let abusive adults play games with you.

Yeah what OP's mom did is a great way to make a person closed off and overly protective of their privacy and stuff. My parents and brother were always using or losing my stuff without any sort of permission and now I get extremely anxious at someone touching anything of mine, coming into my home, or doing anything like that. I imagine OP's mom, much like my family, will wonder why I barely talk to them if at all.

LV keeps track of all of their customers in their database. They might be able to look up the date code of your bag. Include this info in the police report. It could help in the process of recovering your bag, especially if it was sold to a pawn shop or consignment shop. Include such information (and receipt/box if you still have those). Louis Vuitton can definitely get you a new receipt of your purchase if you ask. I do not believe the bag was "damaged" or lost. I have a Speedy from 1989 that I ABUSE.

My cousin once stole my grandmother's jewelry. Some pieces were found at a local pawn shop along with a photocopy of my cousin's ID, because they document people who sell things to them. If it was pawned and the pawn shop owner has documentation that your mother or friend pawned it, bam, that's the proof you need if you want to press charges.

Of course, that's if it were pawned. But no way the bag is "damaged" after one day of usage. LV bags are suburb quality, and you'd have to destroy the bag on purpose.

I agree, something fishy is going on.

My dad accidentally drove his car over a 30-year old LV travel bag once (forgot it was there while unpacking after a trip). The contents were mostly crushed but the bag itself was completely fine, just had to wipe the dirt off!

Googling local pawn shops and and consignment shops to get their phone numbers would be a good start. Just ask has anyone sold a Louis bag fitting the description of your bag. Pawn and consignment owners might even have video or just remember who sold it to them. Hopefully, your mom has a distinct look.

If you are in school, a trusted teacher or guidance counselor may be able to help you.

This would be the best-case scenario, because it's the only one where it's possible (not likely, but possible) that OP might recover the money.

Unfortunately, it's more likely that the mom sold it for much less than it was worth. That's also why she can't replace it.

Back in the 70s, whenever my mother and her siblings got Christmas money, my aunt and uncle would spend it right away on chocolate and toys. My mother stored her cash in a box under the bed. One day she went to spend it on a toy she saw and it was gone. Her parents insisted she spent it all, gaslit her that she forgot buying toys with it then shouted her for angrily protesting.

Also she hid notes in a photo frame and that was stolen too. What sort of parent raids rooms like that? It wasn't a sibling, because they didn't suddenly have mysterious money. My grandparents probably spent it on themselves.

I've got news for you. Your mom sold it. Go check the pawn shops in your area and I'm willing to bet you'll find it. Also, if you want exclusive and cool, go thrifting. Often people donate stuff that is designer and don't realize or care. You can pick up some great vintage designer stuff that just needs a little bit of love and leather oil. Also, many designers will buy back their vintage stuff. Not all but a few

"Oh hello unnamed friend, so nice of you to stop by! Why don't we first go into my daughter's room. Look at this nice bag! Oh, you want it? No problem, go ahead and keep it!"

Not even a good story. OP should check local pawn shops, I bet someone that careless with their story didn't bother checking the receipt to get the whole value.

I'd be more worried that this sounds a lot like addict behavior. Not guaranteed, not 100%, but... concerning, because there was never going to be a good excuse for how the bag went missing from her room.

No way, you're not the asshole! You worked hard for that bag, it was special to you.

[–]Darkmagosan 7 points 11 hours ago 

There's no 'loan' here. This is likely straight up theft. Like others have said, OP should ask for the contact info of the 'friend' who 'borrowed' it. Watch Lying Thieving Egg Donor go ballistic because she's been found out. It's not a huge leap of logic because this bitch's story is thinner than dollar store toilet paper.

OP needs to file a police report now. Kids may not have *legal* property until they're 18, but that's usually stuff like they can't buy land, cars, etc. or enter contracts until they're 18. Personal property, like game consoles, clothes, and handbags (including luxe ones), is still understood to belong to the minor. A friend of mine is a family law judge. If this landed in *his* courtroom, Lying Thieving Egg Donor would be nailed to the wall for a stunt like this. He doesn't fuck around, nor should he.

Take your mom's friend to small claims if possible (I'm not from the US, so I don't known if that's an option for a minor). And report the bag as stolen, since you never gave permission to her to use it.

[–]BecGeoMom 52 points 10 hours ago 

Try telling your mother that you’ve thought about what she said, and you are going to report her friend to the police for stealing your bag. Her friend, if she even exists, did not “lose” your bag. She stole it. If there is no friend, and I suspect there isn’t, your mother stole it. Tell her if she won’t give you her friend’s name, she can tell it to the police. See how she reacts to that and what she says.

Louis Vuitton purses are thousands of dollars. Even second hand they can be that expensive. You trusted your mother and sisters to leave the purse alone. You left it on your desk; you didn’t even lock it away or try to hide it. Emphasize to your mother that you trusted her. She broke that trust, and now the purse if gone.

Do report it to the police. I don’t know if they’ll do anything, but if your mother knows you did that, she might just tell you the truth. Good luck.

No you never do forget that stuff. Big or small when it comes to your parents. My mom told me that my pet rabbit died when I was at summer camp for the week. I found out years later that she sold him. The bigger kicker was when I moved out at 19 and got my own place I found out I couldn't get electric in my name because she used my social security number to put the bill in my name (I was 15-16) there was 1,200 owed. I tried to explain to them it wasn't me and they said without proof it was her and a police report they couldn't do anything. Also I had wanted a Playstation so bad as a kid and finally saved up money to get one I was 9 or 10 so it took a while.. I took it to my dads house on the weekend and when I came back the next week it was gone. He never admitted to selling it kept telling me I never left it there. My dad was also a gift giver and would easily get rid of them in an instant. He built me a go kart I got to drive it once and he sold it. He bought me a dog I had him for a month and he gave it away. So both my parents are shitty.

It's not about the bag though, it's the fact your mother stole from you. You have now learned that your mother is not a safe person, and can't be trusted, whether she meant to teach you that or not. The fact that your sisters side with her shows they are not safe people either and are just as untrustworthy.

Personally I don't buy the 'borrowed and lost' story for a second, I'd say your bag was expensive and either your mom pawned / sold it for money, or she's covering for one of your sisters stealing it.

You are NTA, and for the remainder of your childhood I recommend you learn all about the grey rock method, keep working, save your money, to be safe open a new bankaccount in your name only that only you have access to, just in case, and when you're 18, move out and don't look back. You will do great in life, you just won't have family, which hurts, but you'll be much better on your own than surrounded by people that steal and lie to you, gaslight you abbout it, and are not safe to go to when you have actual emotional problems.

Call the cops, you've been robbed, by your mother.

However, don't expect them to do anything. You're 15. Basically, everything you own, your parents own, too, including your paychecks. She'll tell them that the family needs the money for food, rent, etc., and spending that much money on a purse was a waste of scarce family resources, so she sold it. The cops will go right along with it.

But reporting her to the cops, having them come to your house, and questioning her like the thief she is, will still scare her, although the final outcome will be that she will ultimately be told she can take anything she wants from you.

You might prevail in small claims court. A judge might be more sypathetic.

Edit: Also, check your credit report, and make sure she hasn't taken out credit cards in your name. If she has, call the cops. She doesn't have the right to steal your credit, that's Identity Theft, a serious crime.

If she has stolen your credit, tell your sisters, because she probably did it to them, too. That should get them to stop siding with her, and support you.

Either this story is completely fake or your mother stole and sold your bag. No way she randomly thought of showing a friend your bag and her friend asked to borrow it and then she lost it. Like, not one single part of this story can be true. You're either the victim of a very toxic mother or someone with nothing better to do than making up stories for Reddit.

Your sister's reaction makes me wonder if they were all in on it. Maybe mom gave them some of the money to keep them quiet since they were home. Or maybe they are just jealous. Either way, you are being gaslighted by everyone here, and there is some suspicious behavior going on. No one is going to LOSE one of those bags unless they're brainless. And NO ONE loanes out something that expensive if they have to work for a living.

Please file a police report. It wouldn't surprise me if the bag somehow mysteriously turns back up.

Now to the more important question: where do you keep your money? Is it in a safe, secret spot? In the bank? If it’s in the house, make sure it’s REALLY hidden. If it’s in the bank,make sure your mom doesn’t have access to it. Your mom already stole your purse, who’s to say she won’t steal you money next?

Someone stole it. I have no sympathy for someone that would steal from me, least of all "family." File a police report, if you know the friend call her and ask her first to return it, if she knows nothing about it then it's possible your mom stole it and pawned it. Either file a police report again her friend or your mom, it's the only way they will learn. as it's more than x amount it's possibly a felony theft.

[–]TheSugaredFox 10 points 11 hours ago 

Sorry OP but my mom was an addict who even after sobriety couldn't be trusted with money. My sister is only 6 years older than me but since she turned 18 she paid for almost everything for me via direct transaction purchase, never sending my mom the money. Because she couldn't trust my mom to use the money for me and she also couldn't even trust mom's "needing the money for xxx" without a receipt, so to speak. She would mail checks directly from Hawaii to the mainland school I attended thousand+ miles away to make sure I had a modicum of normality. Every time she got me a gift, she had it engraved and otherwise customized to completely plummet it's resale value just to keep my mom's hands off of it.

I'm not saying your mom is an addict, but I am saying she clearly needs to be treated similarly. I know it hurts, but telling her no is going to be a fruitless battle. From now on, keep working, find a TRUSTED adult with a safe or willing to set up a savings acct for you in their name with a writen agreement that they are helping protect you from financial abuse by setting up a gtfooh fund, and the minute you can, use that money to get out. Until you leave her home she is going to feel entitled to EVERYTHING you bring into it. Even after you leave, she may decide she's entitled to everything in YOUR home because "without her you wouldn't exist. She provided for you for all those years and you're ungrateful to say no to her taking that 350 dollar vase you got as a housewarming/graduation gift from a family friend who knows this story about the purse and wanted to aurora's you with a new nice Shiney pebble now that you had your own place.

Normally yes you need to set boundaries. But your mom reads too much like my own for me to even fantasize about that working out for you.

Agree. How does a 15 year old going to school full time, and ostensibly working some nights and weekend hours at a restaurant, for a couple of months, make enough money for a Louis Vuitton bag? They must have been paid decently above minimum wage, which is wild for a 15 year old at their first job, as a hostess or bussing tables, which typically aren’t included in tipsharing.

This is gonna become a part of your life very quickly. In fact I guarantee throughout the years the things that have gone “missing” have gone missing via your mom. I can’t gaurentee the police can get the bag back, and I can’t say your mom will be any kinder to you. But what I can tell you is that will scare your mom and hopefully her friend. And be there with the police to call your mom out on any lies. Grab your screenshots. Conversations with your sisters, your mom, anything that mentions this situation.

Is there any way you can also maybe call grandma and/or grandpa to come and get you. It would be best to do all this with a safe guardian with you and at a safe location. But also I would call sooner rather than later for the chance to get your purse back not used heavily and filled with lipstick chips and smelling of smoke 😤

What your mom did was wrong and illegal. Provided you have receipts that show your proof of purchase and ownership and you also have to pay stubs that show the deposits and everything points to it being yours, You need to file a police report. If your mom's friend stole the bag then she needs to deal with the consequences, If your mom sold the bag then her friend's going to get into trouble and she's going to have to deal with the consequences.

You can't teach an adult a lesson by yelling at them the way they yell at you. You teach them a lesson by making them deal with adult consequences. Your property was stolen call the cops.

Just to make sure that she doesn't try any streisty stuff, I would call now and then tell her later that I'm thinking about it and then see what happens.

NTA. One of two things happened the friend decided to keep it and or they sold it or your mom sold it. It definitely wasn't lost. It was deliberately taken and most likely sold. And yes your mother should reimburse you.

NTA

Why was your mom's friend in your room to see the bag in the first place? I checked their website and the smallest cheapest bag I could find was $500. I'm assuming you actually paid closer to 1k for it. I'd show your mom the receipt, if she does nothing after seeing the cost then I'd get the info for the friend and confront her (she stole from a child for God's sake) and if that doesn't work I'd go to the police.

Alternatively next time one of your friends are over and they see something of your mom's that they'd like to borrow, let them. I mean it's petty and you'll probably get in trouble but it has the potential to show your mom what she did to you.

File a police report, your mom probably stole it and sold it

Your mom and her friend stole from you. You should file a police report and have them charged.

Sorry you live in an abusive household.

Remember this when you're an adult and have to make care decisions for your mother.

[–]MaleficentGold9745 4 points 10 hours ago 

Your Mom stole the bag and sold it because she found out how much it was. You will never see it again and you will never see your mother in the same way again. She is a trash human being and she knows it and you don't need to be angry and lash out. People who are abusive like that will turn it on you when you respond and call out their bad behavior. I can see you already internalizing it by censoring yourself here. You have every right to call her out and be angry. There is no lesson in this for you other than sometimes life isn't fair and our parents can be and do terrible things. I'm really sorry this happened but I suspect it's not the first time that your mother is done something like this and it won't be the last. Just be aware and try not to covet things until you're old enough to live on your own.

File it as stolen and sue your mum..

[–]osnapitzmika 5 points 10 hours ago 

NTA - I’m in agreement with a lot of people here, the most likely scenario is that your mom sold it. Unfortunately I don’t think that filing a police report will get your bag back, but it will show your family how serious you are about this.

That being said - I’d suggest starting off with asking your mom questions. Who borrowed it? How can you contact her? Can you retrace her steps with her that day? Etc. go the sweet and due diligence route, make it clear that you want this bag back and will do what you need to before dropping the bomb I filed a police report (which I would def do without notifying your mom until after the fact)

Either your mom or the friend sold it (or were in cahoots on it).
Get the friend’s details and tell your mum you don’t believe they ‘lost’ it in 1 day (did they even tell you where and how they supposedly lost it?), and are reporting it as theft unless it’s replaced by one of them.

[–]aldo_rossi 4 points 10 hours ago 

First btch to replace your bag to its spot on your desk is the only btch who gets to label you an a$$h0le or anything negative. Remember: that bag is e$pen$ive. What you forgot is that it will forever be treated like jewelry, and all such valuables have engraved serial numbers. I tell you this because if you have the receipt, you need to file a police report right away, and against you MOTHER because she is the one who “borrowed” it and knows who she then lent it to; the police can and will investigate which means mama-mafiosa will be treated as a suspect in a felony case, which is what grand theft is in the United States. She rolled the dice and lost and you need to clean up her mess. And maybe you need to graduate to head of your lil crime family asap.

Next time, get an insurance policy to cover theft of your valuables. The insurance company is much more dedicated and resourceful about recovering lost property than are police - who primarily focus on keeping the public safe and orderly (non-violent)

Good luck. And sorry to speak ill of your family, but i’m going from what you have posted here. I am sure they have some redeeming qualities too.

[–]Unwilling_Jellyfish 4 points 9 hours ago 

NTA. Your mom definitely sold it. Is she a drug user or tight for cash? Her story holds zero water . What a terrible thing for her to do, and then to ground you for her own f-up/selfishness?? Just lowest of low! She sucks. If she loaned it out and lost it (which she has no right to do and it's not even a true story anyway), it's her responsibility to REPLACE it. It sounds like she would never do the right thing. Your Mom, if you don't already realize it, is a POS. I'm so sorry.

You are NTA. I’m sorry your mom lied to you. If you were like me as a teen and your parents have access to your bank account because you’re a minor try to pull cash out and keep it hidden somewhere else don’t ever keep all your money in one place. If you work in a restaurant cash tips will make that easy. And don’t hide all of it in the same place. You’ll know right away someone is stealing from you but you won’t be screwed and lose everything

[–]Confident-Gap40 4 points 9 hours ago 

Wtf? You are NTA. I’m not virtue signaling here. I just want to explain what another mom feels when her 15 yo daughter has a small LV purse that is not mine… I don’t touch it unless it’s to place it out of the way of whatever I need to do. I don’t covet it or show my friends unless it’s a picture. I literally don’t care about it. I understand the value of it and that it’s not my possession… it’s hers. My daughter also works to buy the things she wants and those things are hers. I don’t have any right to them. Just as she’s allowed to ask if she can borrow something that is mine, I’m free to ask but have to be ok with it if her answer is “no”.

    permalinkembedsavereportreply

[–]Stabbycrabs83 4 points 9 hours ago 

Think about the sequence here

1:My daughter has a shiny new bag

2: Oh can i see it?

3: its in her room

At this point as a parent this is where i have stopped. You may only be 15 and living under my roof but your room is your space. While i can go in there as its my house, as your parent ill wamt to respect your space to a degree

4: takes clearly unused bag ou 5: oh thats nice, can i borrow it?

99.9% of parents would be stopped by this point. Its not mine, i didnt pay for it, its brand new, its expensive, i had to go Into your room to get it, you saved up for it and you idolise it. All those things are blaring in your head

6: where is my daughters bag? 7: oh i lost it sorry

Again normal parents dont accept this. You lost it then you bought it. If they refuse then its on me to get a new bag as the lender.

Long story short your mum sold the bag, this isnt a whoopsie there were opportunities to stop everywhere if shes telling the truth

I'm sorry, but your mom sold your bag, and she's now trying to throw her friend under the bus. My mother stole from me all the time and tried placing the blame on others, including me. The one that stuck out with me the most is when she stole $50 in birthday money I had saved. My mother actually let me tear my whole room up looking for this money, knowing good and well she pocketed it.

Edited for spelling errors.

[–]LadyMaynooth 5 points 8 hours ago 

NTA. If your mother won't identify the "friend", report it as stolen to the police. LV products have serial numbers, also known as the date code. This code is usually found on a small leather tab inside the bag, and it provides information about where and when the bag was made. Even if you have lost the receipt, the store where you purchased it should have a record of the transaction so you can obtain the serial number. Check local pawn shops as quickly as possible.

It's not just a bag. They are very expensive.

But when you get these bags, it puts a target on your back. I'm sorry. They're very easy to steal and with resell websites, easy to sell for cash.

I advise you to file a police report for theft and not keep valuable items like this laying around until you move out. It's sad you can't trust your family and it's a very hard lesson to learn.

    permalinkembedsavereportreply

[–]MimZWay 5 points 8 hours ago 

NTA - Contrary to your sisters’ opinions- this isn’t about the bag. It’s about trust and respect. You can no longer trust your Mother. At best she thought she was being generous to a friend with your belongings and it backfired. At worse- she sold your bag, pocketed the money and lied to your face about it. Either way, she has destroyed your trust in her. I am sorry your own Mother did this to you and I’m sorry your sisters aren’t recognizing your Mother’s behavior for what it is.

Nta. In my 20’s I saved up and bought a beautiful, expensive black leather jacket. I am tiny and it took me ages to find something that fit well. My mom (full on narcissist type) borrowed it without me knowing, wore it Vegas, left it on the back of a chair, and that was that. When I informed her I’d spent a 1000 on that jacket and politely asked her to refund me, she said I was stupid to have spent that much money on something, how much money had she spent on me all my life (btw I started working at 13 and paid my own college education) and of course never paid a dime. You are SO NTA and I wish I could be your mom and apologize to you sincerely for my lack of judgment and take you shopping to get the perfect purse. It’s what you deserve.

    permalinkembedsavereportreply

[–]Coastal-kai 4 points 8 hours ago 

Your mom is disrespectful, at the very least. Disregarded the effort it took to get the bag. Disregarded your planning to get the bag. Casually lent your stuff to her friend, without asking. Take this for what it is. And consider it to be the way your future will go with her. She’ll take anything of yours she wants, without asking. That’s not maternal. That’s stealing.

Maybe look Into that ! 1:1 quality is what you would want . Either way I’d sit down with mom and say your dissapointed because she’s supposed to protect you and always have YOUR best interest first , and she put all of that aside for a “friend” I’m soo sorry your mama did this .
