        <p class="muted">Please watch the source video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXz0kbMKPu0">YouTube</a> This text is auto generated and could contain errors.</p>
        <p>Our world is built on an idea. It's an idea so powerful that we fight and die for it. We draw our maps around it. It shapes our politics and forms the basis of our very identity—who we think we are. It's an idea so pervasive that you've probably never even stopped to notice how weird it is. Because here's the thing: this idea is completely made up, and even though it might feel like it's been around forever, it's actually newer than you think.</p>
        
        <p>Nation. It says that a country is more than just the land drawn into a set of borders. It's actually a giant community that is united by heritage and identity. It says that the people, the land, the state—they're all one thing. That thing is called a nation. You're not just a person who happens to live in a place called America; you're American, or Brazilian, or Japanese, or Mexican, or Egyptian, Nigerian, Dutch, Micronesian. But let's stop a moment to learn the story of where this idea came from and how it took over everything. Because once you do, so much about our world suddenly makes sense.</p>
        
        <p>It feels wrong to call it made up, I know. Like it sort of contradicts everything you've ever been told about the world. That's Max Fisher, my old colleague who taught me a lot about journalism. Max was a New York Times columnist, he wrote this book, and now he hosts a couple of podcasts. He recently planted this idea in my mind of just how fake countries really are. So I wanted to bring him on to help me understand it and then explain it to you.</p>
        
        <p>It really does feel like countries are natural, like they're a fundamental law of humans and human society. Well, take France as an example. If I tell you France is made up, that feels wrong. I mean, it does feel wrong because I look at a bunch of old maps and even way back in time there is a shape on the map called France. So the kingdom of France, whatever, and it's changed, but France was there for a really long time. But okay, think about it. Is that true?</p>
        
        <p>France, like most countries, is built around a story. And that story says that there's always been a French people who share a culture, an ethnicity, and an eternal connection to the land. The borders and the government might have changed over the years, but this land has always been some version of France. Wrong. It's not true.</p>
        
        <p>We think that borders like France's formed because they contained people with the same ethnicity who spoke the same language, right? But when you overlay a map of the actual genetic makeup in Europe, it looks like this. Now look at France and you'll see that any given part of the country has closer genetic links with foreigners across the border than they do with their own countrymen.</p>
        
        <p>But you talk to Europeans who see their country as the home of their unique ethnic group, and I think there's even studies on this that show that Germany is for Germans and Italy is for Italians. These borders were drawn around groups of people because of their common ethnicity. So people from certain areas might share certain traits, like red hair for example. But look at a map that shows the distribution of red hair and you see stuff like this never lines up with national borders.</p>
        
        <p>Okay, so countries aren't correlated with ethnicity. But what about language? Today, sure, people within these borders predominantly speak one language, but this only happened really, really recently. Here's a map of languages in France as of the early 1800s. Only the people in this one area spoke something close to modern-day French. Most people in France spoke something else and had for hundreds of years.</p>
        
        <p>So people living in this land were culturally and genetically fractured. That's what these maps show. And they spoke a bunch of different languages, but they still belonged to one big political entity. Like there was a France here. Again, I've got this tool and I scroll all the way back to the 1200s and I see a thing called the kingdom of France ruled by a king who was apparently ruling people who lived on all of this land. So wouldn't these people be considered French? Isn't this proof that countries have existed for hundreds if not thousands of years?</p>
        
        <p>Actually, no. Not in the way that we mean countries today. For someone living down here, hundreds of kilometers from the king's palace in Paris, there was no concept of being French. They'd probably identify with the people in their village or their town, but that is about it. Like, what do you care if another town hundreds of miles away happens to be ruled by the same king who, by the way, is just some guy who levies taxes on you occasionally?</p>
        
        <p>So French people at this time were more like subjects who happened to be ruled by the same person living in a faraway capital, as opposed to today where countries are more like one giant club where we all feel unified and we're willing to die for a national story. And borders used to fluctuate all the time. If you lived up here and your town switched from the French king to the English king, did your identity suddenly flip from French to English too? No, you're still just a farmer from a village trying to scrape by.</p>
        
        <p>So that's France. There were divided languages and ethnicities, arbitrary borders, and not really a sense of unified France. But what about elsewhere? Is this happening everywhere? That's everywhere.</p>
        
        <p>But what about China? China was a place where you had a powerful imperial government. They were proud of their identity. They saw themselves as the world's central civilization. When I look at Chinese history, there seems to be this cultural identity that lasted and lasted and still seems to into today. So that version of ancient Chinese identity that you're referring to, that was felt strongly among the political elite in the capital, but basically nowhere else. Most people under their rule did not speak Chinese and did not think of themselves as Chinese. The borders were always shifting and even sometimes split between rival empires, which meant there was no fixed sense of what constituted the Chinese people or Chinese land. So actually very similar to the French story.</p>
        
        <p>If I look at my little time lapse of maps, eventually the shape of France does turn into France, the France that we know today. How does that happen? A big step in that direction, and this applies for China too, is by becoming an empire.</p>
        
        <p>Empires. Yes, I know empires. That's something that I've actually looked quite a bit into and I want to approach the imperial history of France and Europe and the world but through this lens of it was very fractured and sort of see where it goes from there.</p>
        
        <p>Max has sufficiently convinced me that countries aren't real, that they're made up in our minds, and that France was not a real country until recently. So I've been looking into what happens next, trying to answer this question of when does France start to look like the France of today? The first thing I thought of here was the French Revolution, the late 1700s. What looks more like national spirit than a bunch of people rising up together to overthrow their king? Let them eat cake. But it turns out that we're not even close. People at this time still basically didn't speak French. They didn't share some French identity. In fact, the French Revolution can kind of be seen as the start of the long road of building a French identity, the process of a bunch of fractured communities unifying under one story.</p>
        
        <p>This revolution embodied a fairly new idea that the government actually derives its legitimacy not from God or some other natural right but from the people themselves. That all of these people were not royal subjects but rather citizens. That this country was theirs, which turned all of this land, at least in their minds, into a new kind of thing—the soil that they came from and owned together. But listen, this is all still really abstract in people's minds. It's a very new idea and it would remain so until this guy came around.</p>
        
        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte advanced the process of turning France into France perhaps more than any other French person. Remember how France looked like this? Well, Napoleon started to make it look a lot more like this. He rallied the people around this new idea of patriotism, complete with symbols and songs and art that emphasized French greatness, the idea that we all belong to one giant tribe. This idea was further cemented when Napoleon recruited men from all around this country to come join his army to fight for France, giving them the sense that they were all joined in a glorious national fight and in the process spreading that nationalistic idea all throughout Europe.</p>
        
        <p>Napoleon did something else that was very important and you can see it in this painting. Instead of pledging loyalty to the pope as European kings had always done, here he is crowning himself. The Catholic Church at this time had been declining in power and Napoleon was sidelining it in favor of himself, his imperial cult of personality. This was a pretty smooth power play but it also helped shift people's sense of loyalty away from religion and towards their nation.</p>
        
        <p>By the end of his reign, Napoleon's France was pretty unrecognizable from those scattered, loosely connected kingdoms that had dominated this land for many, many years. It was looking a lot more like one thing, like a country. But there was still a lot more to do before France became as unified as we think of it today. Their revolution eventually faltered, these Napoleonic wars didn't really work out, but then something bigger happened: industrialization.</p>
        
        <p>What Napoleon and others previously had done had helped unify France kind of mentally, psychologically, but what industrialization does is it unites it physically with iron and concrete. Here come all these factories, and factories need trains to bring in raw materials and to send out finished products. So you see all these new train networks that put France's towns within just a few hours of each other, interlinking communities that had always been separated by distance. In turn, this brought more people into the cities, melting pots of people from all over the country now swirling around together. All of their little regional identities were mixing into a new French identity, something they all shared. Factory work more and more required people to read, so the government built a national school system. They taught the French language along with French national pride and values. Soon all the Breton and the Occitan would become Frenchmen. The school teachers were kind of like heroes; they were nicknamed the foot soldiers on the front lines of this effort to indoctrinate the next generation in this new national identity.</p>
        
        <p>Rising literacy meant mass media, newspapers. Now people could read about the events of the day, making them feel a part of a community. They could keep up to date on the nation's politics, making the capital feel within reach to everyone. Remember how Napoleon had built all of those outposts throughout the country? Well, now thanks to all of these advances in travel and communication, the central government could actually rule over these places, over every corner of the country through a uniform, universal government system rather than through local lords and magistrates. And like in the schools, they mandated that all of this was done in the French language and conveying the French national story, pride in the nation.</p>
        
        <p>So yeah, when Max says that the nation is a new thing, he's really right. It wasn't until like 1870 or 1880 that you start to see a modern French identity that kind of looks like the one we know today. Some historians, like the guy who wrote this book, argue that it didn't really fully happen until the 1910s, like 100 years ago. Some beautiful maps in this book, by the way.</p>
        
        <p>So countries are a new thing, but here's the deal: our leaders don't want us to know that. In France, the ruling elite at the time didn't want to admit that France was kind of a new thing. That would sound way too weak and delicate, so they kind of constructed a national mythology that implied that France has kind of been around forever. They wanted people to believe that the idea of France was eternal, it was fixed, and therefore so were these borders, this shape. That was a much more compelling story that created a sense of loyalty and patriotism among the French people, and it totally worked. This idea spread not just in France but throughout this whole continent. In Italy, it began when an ambitious rabble-rouser set his followers marching on Rome, and eventually our entire world would be built off of this idea.</p>
        
        <p>This was happening all over Europe. So France's nation-building really seems like it was top-down. Was it like that everywhere? It's a lot of both top-down and bottom-up. Napoleon had spread these ideas as he conquered across Europe, and as that way of thinking sunk in, more and more people wanted a nation. People all over Europe staged this wave of revolutions that mostly failed but got people animated to fight for what they saw as unrealized national homelands. Some fought wars of independence or unification that did eventually create nations.</p>
        
        <p>Italy eventually did that, right? It was super fractured seemingly, and then it all comes together. Yes, though even when Italy finally unified in 1861—wait, 1861? That's so recent. Oh, it gets even wilder. Only 2.5% of people in the new Italy even spoke Italian, and almost none of them even thought of themselves as Italian. One of the unification leaders has this famous quote that I love. He said, "We have made Italy, and now we have to make Italians."</p>
        
        <p>Wow, so how do you do that? How do you make Italians? It was mostly the same as in France: schools, national administration, industrialization, and a lot, a lot of national myth-making. So what I saw was that France doesn't finish that process until like 100 years ago, like 1910. Was it the same for Italy? Italy started even later and it was not as industrialized as France had been, so it went much slower. Even by 1950, only 20% spoke Italian, and people mostly identified with their regional language or with their city and not with Italy. That only really changed with the first national TV channels in the 1960s. There was even this famous TV show, "It's Never Too Late," that taught people Italian. All of which is to say that this process of internal nation-building, of becoming a country, can take like a century, and it's all really recent.</p>
        
        <p>What's crazy about this is once you start to really get your head around the national myth, you kind of see it everywhere and you start to see how much it has influenced our modern history, identities that have led to war and conflict all over the world. So let's go back to Europe really quick and look at a few more, like Germany. Germany unified in like the 1860s and '70s. Its process was a lot like Italy, and it actually inspired other countries to rise up with this ethnic nationalism all across Europe, carving old empires into new countries: Serbia, Romania, Norway, Bulgaria, Albania. A lot of them followed a similar template.</p>
        
        <p>But the invention of all of these new countries was kind of like a powder keg that eventually exploded into the First World War. The winners got together and redrew the entire map around the national idea: one nation for one people. The idea is that this would kind of create peace because if one people were just in these boundaries, then there would be no need to fight wars, right? Wrong. Because borders were never going to be perfectly drawn around a people. Like this is Germany's border, but this is where all the German speakers are. You can see they don't line up. So instead, all of this redrawing of borders led to ultra-nationalists rising up across Europe on promises to conquer the land that they considered rightfully theirs, which led to yet another world war.</p>
        
        <p>This gets to the dark side of the idea of a nation. It very naturally breeds the persecution of minorities because if a nation is supposedly defined by its shared ethnic identity, then anyone who is not in that majority identity is an outsider. They're a threat to the character of the nation. Now, of course, the national identity, the national character, the ethnic identity—all of this was made up. But boy, did people start to believe that it was real. Fascists would go on to murder millions in the name of nationalism, an idea that was basically invented 70 years earlier.</p>
        
        <p>We've been talking about Europe, but things like railways and mass media spread around the world, and so did the idea of a nation. Just like in Europe, communities tied by language or history started to think of themselves as nationalities ready to fight for nations of their own. Oftentimes this happened in places where people were forced together by arbitrary imperial borders, often drawn by Europeans. But even that was a unifying idea that led people to rise up, to kick their colonizers out, and to fight for their own national idea. Soon the entire world would be defined by this idea of the nation: firm borders, centralized governments, flags, and pride in your country.</p>
        
        <p>But while this looks neat on a map, it's not perfect because the idea of a nation is inherently imperfect. We have this idea that every person is entitled to a nation of their own, but the way those people identify ebbs and flows and changes and often doesn't fit perfectly into one box. We start wars over territory that our national myth says belongs to us. We fight over who belongs in our national community and who doesn't, and who gets to decide. So much of the conflict and violence in our world today comes from our belief in the nation. My question in all of this is, is there a better way, a more peaceful way to organize ourselves?</p>
        
        <p>And yet it feels like we're stuck in this way, these identities that seem so firm and they seem like they're getting firmer and more intense every year. Like this is the only way that we can organize our world, by countries and nationalities. The good news is that it's not necessarily as fixed as you might think. National identities can change. Let's go back to France, where it's becoming more accepted that you can be French regardless of your race or religion or your place of birth. But at the same time, there's also a rising backlash to that, that clings to the idea of France as just for the French.</p>
        
        <p>People need some sort of collective identity to hold on to, and national identity is just the one we have right now. It seems like one answer is that we still have these identities that are fixed around land and borders, but that they can expand and become bigger and take on different meaning. Like the idea of European—that feels like an identity that is very real. It's still collective and it's still defined, but it doesn't have the danger of exclusion, ethnicity, competition, and war, at least not within those big borders.</p>
        
        <p>Think of people who live in a big global city like New York or Hong Kong or London or Singapore, and this identity that you are a person of the world, that you're a globe traveler, that you're taking in many different cultures. That's kind of a cosmopolitan identity. Ironic, we don't think of that as an identity, but it absolutely is, and it's one that's taking the place of national identity.</p>
        
        <p>What else do you think exists out there that could replace this? And does the nation ever go away, or does it just get watered down and become less salient over time? There are lots of places that you can get your sense of identity and your sense of community from. I mean, I think there are people who find that in religion. You can find that in your profession. You can find that in just your local community, which is the way that a lot of people used to do it. I think the fact that we are all becoming more aware and more conscious of the fact that we need to get community from someplace is making us a little more thoughtful about it and at times more constructive about it. Although you still see this push-pull, which is probably going to go on forever, of do we want a hardened national identity that's about us versus them and who's in and who's out, or do we want to create some sort of a way of thinking about our role in our community and our identity that is more inclusive?</p>
        
        <p>I also wonder often if humans need a "them," an enemy. In a nationalistic context, there seems to have to be a "them" in order for there to be an "us." But I do wonder within our psychology if these identities that don't have an enemy are less potent or have less staying power than the kind of embattled sense of like, "I'm an American and terrorists are out to get me." Having an enemy is such a potent way to coalesce people around fear.</p>
        
        <p>I think that's totally true. I think there is so much evidence that psychologically just our brains are so much more drawn to identities that are defined around fighting and resisting and fearing some group, some "them." But I think that just goes to show that it is something that we have to be conscious about and really thoughtful about in order to rise above.</p>
        
        <p>So this has been a pretty fascinating history for me, and after charting through it, I'm left with this feeling that countries and nations are ideas that we as a world are still learning to live with peacefully. But ultimately, countries are just that—they are an idea. They're flexible, they're malleable, as malleable as our minds. We can change how we draw these lines and who gets left in and who gets left out. It's something that I believe we are slowly figuring out with a lot of bumps in the road. Even though it feels hardwired and fixed, like this is the way it has to be, it only feels that way until someone comes around with a better, more enlightened way to organize the 8 billion people on this planet.</p>
