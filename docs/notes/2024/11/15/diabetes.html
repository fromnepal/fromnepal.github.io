        <p>800 million—that's how many people are suffering from diabetes worldwide. According to a groundbreaking study, diabetes cases have doubled over the past three decades, but the trends differ across nations. More than half of these cases are concentrated in just four countries: India, China, the US, and Pakistan, in that order. So why are some nations worse hit than others? Why is diabetes on the rise, and what can be done about it? Here's a report.</p>
        <p>Diabetes is underestimated, misunderstood, and poorly treated, making it one of the most common medical problems globally. It already affects 800 million people and is on the rise. The prevalence of diabetes has doubled over the past 30 years, which is concerning because diabetes is not a simple disease. It's not just about abnormal blood sugar control caused by a lack of insulin. Diabetes is a chronic and progressive disorder with devastating consequences. It can injure critical bodily systems, damaging the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. This one disease, whether type 1 or type 2 diabetes, can cause a number of other health issues like heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and amputations.</p>
        <p>Diabetes is not equal for all. More than half of global diabetes cases are concentrated in just four countries. India leads with more than a quarter of the cases (212 million), followed by China (148 million), the United States (42 million), and Pakistan (36 million). Out of all the cases, more than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Unlike type 1, type 2 diabetes can be prevented. It's mainly caused by being overweight, eating unhealthily, and not exercising enough.</p>
        <p>So if much of diabetes is preventable, why is it on the rise? There are several reasons. First, growing levels of obesity—nearly 1 billion adults and 159 million children are obese worldwide, fueling a diabetes epidemic. Secondly, a healthy lifestyle is not always affordable. Diabetes has seen the largest increase in low and middle-income countries where unhealthy food is the cheap and convenient choice. Thirdly, more than half of diabetes cases go untreated, and many people in lower-income nations don't get the medication they need.</p>
        <p>What can be done about it? Improving medical access will help curb the disease, making both prevention and diagnosis easier. Reducing the cost of diabetes drugs will help too. In addition, countries need more action to reduce obesity, like greater availability of healthy food and increased taxes on junk food. Diabetes needs policy intervention worldwide. If not, this silent killer will continue to ruin millions of lives.</p>
