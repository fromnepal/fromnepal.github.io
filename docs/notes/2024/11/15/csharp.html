        <h1>What's new in C# 13</h1>
        <p>I'm Matt Ston, I'm an architect at Microsoft and I'm also the lead designer of CP. And I'm Dustin Campbell, I'm an architect on .NET tooling and also a member of the C# language design team and work a lot with this guy. So we have .NET coming out today, .NET 9, and that also means that we have C# 13 meeting the world today and we're here to tell you a little about what's in this version of C#. </p>

        <p>We want to start by taking you on a very brief tour of how you can stay updated on what's going on with C#. Like everything else here, it's open source. So I've got a couple of things up here on my laptop that should show just a couple of ways that if you're new to the C# universe or you want to get involved or stay engaged, we have a few examples of ways to do that at various levels of interest. </p>
        
        <p>This first thing is learn.microsoft.com. This is the "What's New in C# 13" page. If you want to find out what's in the product for C# 13 and get documentation on these things and how they play in, it's all here. This is a great way to get an overview of the language features that have shipped. </p>
        
        <p>As we go, the C# 14 cycle essentially starts now and we tend to put language features out in preview. We actually have one that we'll be showing today that's already going to be in preview. We try to keep the "What's New" page updated even with preview documentation of preview features as well, so it is a good place to keep an eye on C# as it evolves over the year. </p>
        
        <p>Another spot you can look at is on GitHub in the Roslyn repo, which is where the C# and Visual Basic compilers and IDE stacks, all the code lives and where they're in active development. This is the language feature status page in the docs folder, where you can see the nitty-gritty on who's working on what and what we're looking at for C# 13 and also what's happening for next. If you're interested in seeing branches merge, this is where to go. </p>
        
        <p>The working state is really everything that we currently have engineering activity on, like somebody's building. As a C# language design team, we work on even more things that haven't yet started being implemented. The place to go if you really want to engage with the C# design is the separate repo CSharpLang for the language design itself of C#. This is again in the .NET Foundation on GitHub. This is where notes from our language design meetings are posted, where proposals are posted, there's issues and discussions. This is also an active development, though it's not necessarily the code development but where the nitty-gritty of the language design itself happens. If you want to get involved in some way or engage with that, provide feedback, discuss with the team or other like-minded folks, then this is the place to go for that. </p>
        
        <p>There is quite a lot of community contribution in this repo as well to the design of C# as opposed to the implementation we saw before. But I guess we're here to look at code. Let's talk about many of the features in C# 13. Some of them really feel like just bug fixes. We're going to show some of the more interesting ones, but as you could see on that language status page and the "What's New," there's plenty. </p>
        
        <p>In a way, we've been looking at the features that did land in C# 13 and it feels very much like almost not necessarily small features but features that might feel smaller but they are there to just make the consumption of code better, easier, make sure you're doing the right things, putting you on the right path, giving type authors and library authors the right tools they need to help you get on the right path for consuming APIs. </p>
        
        <p>Starting with this one here, params. This has been in the language since C# 1. Params has been around forever and it's always been about arrays. You can have params array and that means that call up there on the first line packages all the arguments for that parameter into an array that gets created on the spot and passed on to the method. Almost immediately after this shipped, we were like, why couldn't we do params IEnumerable? Then .NET 2 came out, C# 2 with generics, and they were like, well why can't I do one with params IEnumerable<T>? </p>
        
        <p>That's been maybe the oldest ask. To be clear, the thing you pretty much have to do and have had to do since C# 2 if you want to have a general API that takes all kinds of collections but also is params is you need two overloads: the general one that takes IEnumerable<T> and then an array one that is params because only arrays can be params. This gives you the way to have something you can, if you've got a list in hand, you can pass that and it will make its way into the IEnumerable<T>. In the other one, you can pass a list of arguments and they'll get into the params. </p>
        
        <p>We've had it on our list for well over a decade to do something about that, but then there's like, well if we do params IEnumerable then what about other things? People will immediately be like, okay params other things, right? So we kind of left it alone. But last year when we were releasing C# 12, a very consequential feature came out which was collection expressions. My favorite feature in years. To be able to surround this with brackets and just say this is now a collection that is not opinionated on the type of that collection. Instead, it decides what the collection is going to be, what the type of the collection is based on its surroundings. </p>
        
        <p>In this case, this is a way that you could also pass it in here and it looks very similar to passing params but really close with just these square brackets. The big difference with collection expressions is that you can pass collection expressions to almost any collection type. There are standard ways that they will work like old-fashioned collection initializers if you don't do anything else, but you can also set things up in your API to tell it what to do to create your collection in a smart way. The compiler special cases a lot of common types and it's really smart. It can create from the same syntactic expression all kinds of different collections and it'll do a really good job at creating efficient implementations of interfaces and that kind of stuff. </p>
        
        <p>In this case, overload resolution is going to make it so it calls the array still, but if I delete that and I can delete that now because I've got that collection expression up there, it will produce the compiler will generate a type that's very efficient that implements IEnumerable for you. You don't have to go and say I'm newing up a list or I'm newing up something else to pass in here, but instead it will new up something that implements IEnumerable<T> so that it can be passed here successfully and efficiently. </p>
        
        <p>That little extra step we took in C# 13 is, okay now we have machinery to create all kinds of different collections from elements, from a list of elements. Couldn't we just do that with params as well? Could we just allow params on all those collection types and have it do the same thing? It turns out we can. This of course is legal in C# 13. We have params for all sorts of things, essentially the things that you can create with collection expressions because we know how to build that machinery now. If I delete these brackets, it works just fine and it's going to do essentially the same thing under the hood as if you passed in a collection expression. </p>
        
        <p>You can pretty much think about it as params is just the compiler putting those square brackets around the elements that you're listing as arguments. Those two features are very closely connected. Now in this case, because it's IEnumerable, we're going to be allocating something under the hood to do this. There are cases where you don't want that. You might wonder what other things we could do with params. If I wanted to do something a little bit more efficient using some of the span-based types that we have, that's also allowed. I could type Span in here, that works, or I could use its readonly cousin to pass in arguments that are essentially from some heap-allocated type, it could be from an array, or they could even just be allocated on the stack. This could point to memory on the stack so that you're not making any objects to pass something in that can then be foreach-ed over like this. </p>
        
        <p>This is probably the second longest request we've had for params is for the span types because the compiler can choose to allocate that span on the stack. When it does, no memory is wasted and it's actually very similar to if you had had all those parameters individually in your signature, they would also have gone on the stack. This is a thing that from a memory layout performance perspective mirrors multiple parameters the best. </p>
        
        <p>There's another piece of this that I think is really interesting which is that overload resolution would like to say that in this case, readonly span is a better overload because it would implement IEnumerable<T>, but of course it doesn't, it can't. It's a ref struct, it can't do that. IEnumerable<T> is not suitable, but still we end up picking the readonly span type here and this is part of another feature of C# 13 that is kind of one of those things that's really under the hood, you won't see it pop up but it will help you do the right thing. </p>
        
        <p>We essentially embarked on a new story arc in C# for spans that is first-class spans. Even though spans have been around now for a long time, a lot of people, they have weird restrictions because they have to live on the stack, so a lot of people don't use them directly. We want to make it so that you can get a lot of benefit from them without having to understand too much of that machinery. The language itself has kind of kept them at arm's length for a bit. There are conversions from array to span to readonly span, but they're not in the language. They've been used to define conversions on the span types, and that means spans haven't felt fully integrated in the language. </p>
        
        <p>We have started down the path of making spans first-class citizens in the language. The down payment on that in C# 13 is that we make spans better than arrays and all the interfaces implemented by arrays in overload resolution. It is the more efficient way generally of doing that, and so it makes sense.</p>
        
        <p>Another thing about params collections is that you can do an IEnumerable, you can do readonly span, but you can do lots of other types. There are also ways with collection expressions to expose them to collection expressions in such a way that the collection expressions know how to build them. One of the types that's been kind of challenging is immutable array. It's one of those types that we use a lot, but it can't be used with the old style collection initializer. The add method on an immutable array doesn't mutate it; it just makes a new immutable array, so it doesn't work. </p>
        
        <p>We made sure that when we added collection expressions that we could support types like these as well, and that means they're also supported with params. You can add a special attribute to make your collections work with collection expressions and also with params. You really have a lot of freedom now in how you use params.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, you want overload resolution to still work. This is one of these things where it's like, oh gosh, what's wrong? Even these sorts of overload resolution problems, like now we've got an ambiguity. In this case, we have params and three different overloads, and you probably wouldn't have that. We could fix it by just saying we probably want the readonly span to be the params one because that's the most efficient of them. That makes the most sense. </p>
        
        <p>But then if I add this, if I make it a collection expression which could be either an immutable array or an IEnumerable or a readonly span, we're right back in the same problem. This is a situation that you sometimes find yourself in if you are consuming or especially if you're writing a library, maintaining a library and adding to it over the years. You want to add new overloads. You want to add that for more efficiency for your users to pick that up when they compile, but now you've introduced ambiguities. </p>
        
        <p>The language just didn't understand the rules of the language were not enough for that particular fine-tuning use case. You were like, okay, maybe I've got some API that we've got a better way to do it in this organization or application. You want it to work and it doesn't work and there's an ambiguity. Now you've got to do other things like change the method names, stuff that you're trying to fit into the rules. Sometimes the language can't make rules that fit everyone. You want to be able to have some agency when you evolve your API to make it so that the user of the API just gets the right stuff and doesn't get presented with that ambiguity.</p>
        
        <p>C# 13 brings something here for that API author, even if it's an internal or public API, to be able to come in and do the fine-tuning to say the rules didn't get it right for me or didn't do what I expected. You can use this new overload resolution priority attribute. What this does is it essentially says all the overloads here have a priority of zero. If I want one to be picked above that, maybe if it's a better choice, then I'm going to give it a higher priority. That actually fixes the issue here, so now it does pick the readonly span.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes what you want is for a particular overload to step behind the others. You can use negative numbers, meaning that you have four billion of these available to you as you build out your applications. Using a negative int here, this actually goes below IEnumerable and immutable array and there's still no error. It's choosing immutable array because now regular overload resolution is kicking in and saying, well, okay, immutable array is a better choice than IEnumerable because immutable array implements IEnumerable.</p>
        
        <p>It's not just a matter of positive and negative. You can use different numbers and they have relative priority. You can use prime numbers, squares, whatever. I would probably use squares. Power of two would run out quickly with just the 32. That's kind of a joke because I feel like this should be used sparingly. This is used for that fine-tuning situation where you just need to get something to choose the right thing. You just need to subvert the rules slightly. If you find yourself actually using 32 of these, you might rethink things. It would still be a smell. Usually, you want your API to by and large work by the rules and not against the grain of the language.</p>
        
        <p>It's mostly situations where you are evolving an API and you want to keep existing code happy even while you are able to take bolder steps like for better performance, like move, add a new overload and move the params to it, that kind of stuff. This doesn't actually have situations where somebody could add an extension method and now subvert your type or something like that. It's only the overloads within this type. The priorities are only used between members of the same type. Essentially, the way it works is it takes all the applicable members, finds the highest priority among them, and only the ones that have that highest priority get to compete for being chosen. If the top one succeeds, then it wins. If it doesn't apply, then it would fall down to the next priority and let them duke it out.</p>
        
        <p>You can still, even though you have a lower priority, get picked sometimes if you're the only one that fits the call. Let's go and look at some other code. That's three features down in C# 13 and we're coming over very little syntax so far. Very little new syntax, actually no new syntax so far.</p>
        
        <p>Here we are in this file. We've got a type called MyFile that's partial. In here, there's a partial method. Think back to C# 2 to remember your partial methods. Down here is the implementation of that partial method. Partial methods have always been used for code generation scenarios. They are ways that you can say here's a method that I want to provide an implementation to in a partial part. They're used more now in the world of source generators. We've had them for a long time, but they're used in source generators as ways that you can, in your type, say here's a hook that the source generator can fill in implementation for or vice versa where you want to provide implementation and the source generator is going to provide a hook. It works very well for these kinds of scenarios.</p>
        
        <p>Up until now, the only member kind that could be partial was methods. We've finally taken the step and added partial properties as well. I can go ahead and add a partial keyword to the implementation side. Now it's complaining that there's no definition, so I'll go ahead and add my definition. I need a private set because we need the accessibility accessors to match.</p>
        
        <p>Why haven't we done this before? It seems so straightforward. The reason there were dragons, but they were more like tiny lizards. We kind of stayed away from it for a couple of years because of that. If you notice that get private set, that looks like the body of an abstract property, but it also looks like the body of a concrete property that happens to be an auto property. We had to make the choice to say that when you put just the accessors and semicolons, is that an auto property that's on the implementation or is that a definition? We just said it has to be a definition. That's the only way this can work sensibly. That means you can't use that same auto property syntax to implement it. You have to do something manually. Auto properties aren't supported.</p>
        
        <p>Hold that thought. Not in that exact auto property syntax that you're used to. This is a great feature for source generation and any code generation scenario. Now it supports properties. We already get requests for supporting partial other member kinds now. As the scenarios warrant, it might be very little work. We'll probably keep looking at that to generalize there, but for now, you've got methods and properties.</p>
        
        <p>That brings us to another feature. Here we're locking some data. We're using this classic lock keyword that's been in C# since C# 1. Not new syntax again, something that's been there for a very long time. In C# 1 and .NET 1, the design was that every object could be something that could be locked on. Any object could be used with the monitor classes in .NET. That pattern is the one on lock, but since then we have had no limits on putting new locks into .NET. There are so many locks to choose from for various situations.</p>
        
        <p>In hindsight, maybe it wasn't the greatest idea to enshrine the first idea we had about locking into the language itself and hard-code it in because it created an adoption blocker for the other locks. They're at a comparative disadvantage just because this very early first one is embraced. There's nothing wrong with it per se, but we can do better. We have a new idea for a lock. That's what this feature is about. We've got a new lock that's in .NET and it's not called SemaphoreSlim or anything like that. It's called Lock. We changed that map lock field from object to lock, the new System.Threading.Lock, and it works with the lock keyword. That's the new feature here. It's sort of just we allow the lock statement to be used with this new lock because we feel that this is used in similar scenarios. It is lighter weight than the old one. The old one has extra baggage with Monitor and features there that felt like, well, okay, something slimmer and lighter weight to be used as kind of the workhorse lock for these scenarios of just protecting data. To be clear, this would have worked even if we had done nothing in C# because Lock is an object. Locking on it by rights should just do the same monitor thing. But what we said here is, that's wrong. Let's embrace this new Lock type in the language. When the lock statement is used on an object of the Lock type, the compiler can see this is the Lock and it will generate the more efficient code to use it as intended.</p>
        
        <p>Does that mean that if I new up a Lock and turn it into an object, that can still use Monitor? Yes, that will still use Monitor, which is the risk of doing something like this. So we put a little guardrail on it. You can see the green squiggle there saying, don't do that, please. If you're creating a Lock object, don't upcast it and forget that it's a Lock because then if you use the result of that in a subsequent lock statement, it won't do the same kind of locking. It can get very dangerous and silly. We put these guardrails in so that people don't mix Lock and non-Lock objects.</p>
        
        <p>The C# compiler has no way of knowing that it's not an object statically unless we build a runtime check into Lock, which would start getting inefficient. So we didn't do that, but we put these guardrails in. Also, to be clear, this is not that we've generalized the lock statement to be pluggable or to have a lock pattern. There's no lock pattern today. This is not that. It's a situation where we just embraced this really good type from the core libraries.</p>
        
        <p>Let's talk about one of our features that's maybe not quite there but is very ready. I've been using it a lot. It is a feature that right now in .NET 9 is only in preview. You can go into your project file, use .NET 9 GA, the general release, and specify LangVersion preview to get access to this feature. We'll come back to why it's in preview and not part of C# 13 proper.</p>
        
        <p>The feature is the field keyword. The ability to, within an auto property, access the backing field. With an auto property, there's always been this big cliff. If you want to do various things like in your setter, you just want to say trim that value that's coming into the string before it gets set, or just lock on something before you do the mutation, you had to declare a field. You couldn't use an auto property anymore and had to specify both accessors even though you only wanted to fiddle with one of them.</p>
        
        <p>We're taking that cliff away with the field keyword. You can use it in accessors and property accesses to say, well, I am an auto property, I do have a generated backing field, and field is how I access it. This one actually does right now because it sets a field that's different from this, which is now the backing field. We're getting a warning here that we should be using field because the other accessor does. That helps me not make a mistake and make sure that I'm using the backing field keyword as well.</p>
        
        <p>The map field isn't needed up there, you can see it's grayed out. We're not referencing it anymore, so we just get a backing field of the same type as the property generated for us. It may be a little excessive that we're actually locking on get. If we amend the get accessor to just return field, we could do so just like this because it's an auto property. I used to think that auto properties had to have a get and a set and semicolons, no bodies. Really, what makes it an auto property is whether you had to have a backing field or one was generated for you. Now auto properties come in this large variation of syntax that you can use to make your property experience much nicer and be more expressive.</p>
        
        <p>Just to circle back to the partial thing from before, now we are actually writing the implementation as an auto property. Because it has an auto property where at least one of the accessors has a body, it doesn't conflict with the definition. We can tell those apart. Because it accesses the field keyword only, it is an auto property, which is exciting.</p>
        
        <p>We should talk about why we didn't just ship it and why it's in preview right now. The reason it's in preview is because this is a breaking change. We've talked with customers who have said they've gone through their codebases and said, I have a lot of fields called field. Maybe they're writing database schemas and they have an object hierarchy and they're talking about fields in their databases. Or maybe it's an academic thing and it's like, well, I have a person that has a field of study, or it's a force field in physics, or it's in Star Wars, whatever. Agriculture, it turns out that many fields have fields.</p>
        
        <p>It's a little bit of a breaking change to start saying, well, inside accessors it's now a keyword. Sometimes this now becomes a problem if you had that field and you were referencing that. We went through many alternative designs in this feature and we're like, this is the best design. This is the one that we're going to be happy that we landed on. Ten years from now, this is going to be right. But in order to do that, we have to do a little more of a breaking change to C# than we usually do. We sat down and said, now's the time for us to come up with a breaking change approach for C# that we can use sparingly, probably not even once every release, though let's see.</p>
        
        <p>You can see that warning you get there. We haven't really implemented that breaking change approach yet, but we're sort of on the way there. Right now it says you can refer to the existing member, you can use this.field to access the field like you would normally if you had a parameter in a field that matched. Or because this is a keyword, the standard way in C# to use a keyword as an identifier and refer to it is with an @. This is kind of what we think this breaking change experience would do some of this kind of work for you and fix up the code that you have so that it doesn't break with the addition of this keyword.</p>
        
        <p>It's probably worth mentioning if you say this.field, that works too. The reason that works is that field is only a keyword if it occurs on its own. We made the blast radius of the breaking change as small as possible. It's only when you use it as a variable name standalone, like if it was a parameter, then it's a keyword. Amusingly, I'm getting that warning back again because now I'm using a field out there called field, but this one uses a backing field. It's kind of funny.</p>
        
        <p>This is where we want to go with field and we hope that it will be ready to go. We want it to be there for C# 14. We would like you all to play with it a bit and for us to understand, are we as right as we think we are about making this breaking change? Help us get the tooling experience and everything right around it so that come C# 14 we can deal with this breaking change with confidence and everyone can embrace this new keyword.</p>
        
        <p>We have one more thing to show. That's we finally get to why this all is a ref struct. Ref structs are the thing that you write only if you're like David Fowler or Stephen Toub or somebody like that. Here we have them. I rarely write them, but sometimes I do. One of the things that's interesting about this particular ref struct is that it has a Dispose method, but it doesn't implement IDisposable itself. The reason for that is that ref structs, if I want to implement IDisposable on this and pass it to something that took IDisposable, .NET would insist on that being boxed into an object because it's a struct. An object that implements IDisposable on the heap, but ref structs can't actually live on the heap. They can only live on the stack. If you want to think about ref structs, your spans and readonly spans are ref structs. Those kinds of limitations, they have to be on the stack. They apply to all ref structs and therefore it would seem that implementing interfaces doesn't make sense because you can't convert to them anyway.</p>
        
        <p>But it does in fact make sense and we've now enabled it. It finds here the Dispose method needed to implement the interface. How do you use it? We go back here and we see these methods actually take IDisposable, but they take it in as a constraint on T. This is where you can now use a ref struct that implements an interface and you can constrain it. I can go right here and type MyFile and all is good until it's not. But it's a start.</p>
        
        <p>Generic constraints are what interfaces are good for on ref structs. That's how you can use them. However, type parameters by default are not expected to be ref structs. You were never able to pass ref structs as type parameters and so they make assumptions. If you have a constraint that says that you implement IDisposable, then you can convert to it. We need to say something about the type parameter that this type parameter actually does allow ref structs. The syntax for that is allows ref struct. Instead of a traditional constraint, it's more like a non-straint. It's an anti-constraint. This T does allow ref structs.</p>
        
        <p>That poses some limitations on the body of that method. Right here is a conversion to IDisposable, but it can't be converted to IDisposable. I can fix that. I could use T right here and because T is constrained to IDisposable and allows ref struct, I can still call Dispose on it, but I can't actually convert it to an IDisposable because of that boxing issue. You've said that you care about not doing that in this method by saying I allow ref structs.</p>
        
        <p>The other reason this works is because in .NET 9 we have added that particular anti-constraint to a bunch of the core interfaces and delegate types. This is implemented on IEnumerable<T>, which now implicitly allows ref structs. If I go over to the source, I can see it's right there. Likewise, if I pick up something like Action<T>, where you've had these delegates for a long time, they've all been updated to allow ref structs so that if you have something that you need to pass into some delegate, you don't have to define a new delegate with the parameter type of that ref struct because you couldn't pass it as a type parameter before. Now you can.</p>
        
        <p>The upshot of the story is that ref structs couldn't participate in any kind of abstraction that you couldn't use for multiple different kinds. You couldn't write or use ref structs for it, and now you can. They can implement interfaces and be allowed into generics, and we do it all over the place. This is also kind of like a first-class thing that's happening with ref structs that we didn't have before. It's enabling a bunch of cool scenarios, and I think there's going to be a lot more to come in future .NET versions.</p>
        
        <p>And with that, we don't have any more to show you today.</p>
