Hey there!

I recently got an email asking if learning to code was still a good idea now that finding a job is not as easy as a couple years ago.

Let me share why learning to code is still an awesome idea, even when the job market seems tough. 

BUT FIRST:

IMPORTANT: I'm in the long overdue process of cleaning my email list.  ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

You seem to be "inactive" in my list. 

I will be deleting subscribers who haven't opened or clicked links in my emails in a while. I already deleted a lot of inactive subscribers, and I'll delete more. If you never clicked links on my emails, click this link (it just brings you to the bootcamp homepage) to "signal" me you're still active and you'll avoid being deleted from the list.

Let's go on üëá

Here's the deal - the tech industry is like a rollercoaster. We've seen this before with the dot-com bubble and the 2008 recession. Right now, we're just getting back to normal after that crazy hiring spree in 2020-2021. It's not that "no one is hiring" - we're just back to a regular job market.

But here's why coding is still totally worth your time:

1. Coding isn't just for tech companies anymore! Whether you're in marketing, healthcare, or finance, knowing how to code makes you super valuable. You can automate stuff, analyze data, and create custom tools.

2. Freelancing is a fantastic option! I've done it myself for years, and let me tell you - the flexibility is amazing. You can work from anywhere, choose your projects, and often earn more than in a regular job. Plus, you're your own boss!

3. Want to build your own products? Coding gives you that power! Whether it's mobile apps, SaaS platforms, or AI tools - the possibilities are endless. It's a great way to create your own opportunities.

4. Here's something cool - coding makes you a better thinker. The problem-solving skills you develop while coding are valuable everywhere, not just in programming.

...and my favorite thing: coding is an awesome craft. I get great satisfaction in building beautiful and functioning apps.

Remember, learning to code takes time - we're talking years, not months. But that's exactly why now is a perfect time to start! When the next tech boom comes (and it will), you'll be ready with solid skills and experience.

So don't let the current market get you down. Keep learning, keep building, and stay curious. The opportunities will come - they always do! 

What do you think? Are you learning to code right now? I'd love to hear your thoughts! üòä
