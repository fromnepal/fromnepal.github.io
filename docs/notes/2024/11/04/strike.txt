New York Times Tech Workers Go on Strike
The Times Tech Guild represents more than 600 software developers and others who run the back-end systems behind The Times’s digital operation.
By Katie Robertson
Nov. 4, 2024
Updated 11:27 a.m. ET
The Times Tech Guild, which represents workers like software developers and data analysts at The New York Times, went on strike early Monday, just ahead of the busy Election Day news period.
The two sides negotiated until late Sunday. The sticking points in recent days were over whether they could get a “just cause” provision in their contract, which means workers can be terminated only for misconduct or another such reason; pay increases and pay equity; and return-to-office policies.
Times management said in an email to workers on Sunday that it had offered a 2.5 percent annual wage increase, a minimum 5 percent pay increase for promotions and a $1,000 ratification bonus. It also said that the company would maintain its current in-office work requirements of two days a week through June 2025, while allowing employees to work fully remotely for three weeks per year.
The guild said in a statement that its members would protest daily outside the company’s headquarters starting at 9 a.m. on Monday.
“They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labor on the picket line,” Kathy Zhang, the guild’s unit chair, said in the statement. “Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract across the finish line.”
The guild said it was asking readers to honor its digital picket line by not playing Times Games products, such as Wordle, and not using the Cooking app. It added that it had filed numerous unfair labor practice charges against The Times with the National Labor Relations Board over the company’s return-to-office mandates and its attempts to interrogate members about their intentions to strike.
Hannah Yang, the company’s chief growth and customer officer, and Jason Sobel, its chief technology officer, said in an email to the tech workers on Sunday night that management had “a strong offer on the table.”
“We are disappointed that the Tech Guild leadership is attempting to jeopardize our journalistic mission at this critical time,” they said in the email, a copy of which was obtained by The Times.
The Times Tech Guild, the country’s biggest union of tech workers with collective bargaining rights, was certified in a National Labor Relations Board election in March 2022. It has been negotiating for a contract since then.
The union voted on Sept. 10 to authorize the strike with the intention of walking off the job around Election Day, when a jump in readership is expected. The union’s more than 600 members maintain the back-end systems running The Times’s digital operation.
A Times spokeswoman said that the company had “robust plans in place to ensure that we are able to fulfill our mission and serve our readers.”
Many New York Times workers are represented by other unions. Times reporters and some editors are part of the Times Guild, while a number of workers at Wirecutter, The Times’s product review website, are also unionized. Those unions, as well as the Times Tech Guild, are affiliated with the News Guild of New York.
Wirecutter Union workers went on a five-day walkout in 2021 over the prime Black Friday shopping weekend to pressure management to agree to a contract. Times reporters and editors held a 24-hour strike in December 2022 over contract negotiations.

NEW YORK TIMES TECH GUILD WALKS OFF THE JOB
Workers who power all NYT technology - including mobile push alerts, app & website maintenance and the ‘election needle’ - begin ULP strike, threatening to be the first NewsGuild work stoppage to coincide with a presidential election day in 60 years.
11/04/2024
NEW YORK – The Times Tech Guild – the union that powers the technology behind election coverage at The New York Times – has walked off the job in a ULP strike that threatens Election Day. 
The work stoppage began at 12:01 a.m. ET Monday despite multiple rounds of intense bargaining and a practice picket that drew more than 400 outside the headquarters of The Times and another 200 remotely on Wednesday.
Tech Guild members will begin picketing at 9 a.m. outside the Eighth Avenue entrance of The New York Times. The picket line will run 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. 
The Tech Guild is asking readers to honor the digital picket line and not play popular NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections as well as not use the NYT Cooking app. Members of the newsroom union, Times Guild, have pledged not to do struck work, a right that’s protected under their contract. 
Despite the risk of a Tech Guild ULP strike disrupting access to news during the presidential election, management has failed to meaningfully address tech workers’ key concerns such as  remote/hybrid work protections; “just cause” job protections, which the newsroom union has had for decades; limits on subcontracting; and pay equity/fair pay. 
Throughout the bargaining process, Times management has engaged in numerous labor law violations, including implementing return-to-office mandates without bargaining and attempting to intimidate members through interrogations about their strike intentions. The NewsGuild of NY has filed unfair labor practice charges against The Times on these tactics as well as numerous other violations of labor law. 
“Our union members and bargaining committee have done everything possible to avoid this ULP strike,” said Kathy Zhang, a Senior Analytics Manager at The New York Times and unit chair of the Tech Guild. “But management is more willing to risk our election coverage than they are to agree to a fair deal with its workers. They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labor on the picket line. Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract done.” 
If no progress is made Monday and the ULP strike continues, it will be the first to coincide with a presidential election in the NewsGuild since the 1964 Detroit Newspaper Strike.  
“This ULP strike by tech workers at The New York Times is a direct result of management’s decision to undervalue their labor as a contract negotiation strategy,” said Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York. “We have been sounding the alarm for weeks and cleared our schedules to get this contract done before the election week deadline. As workers and subscribers, we’re disheartened that the Times is willing to gamble with its election coverage to avoid agreeing to a fair and just contract. We remain ready to bargain and look forward to reaching an agreement our members at Times Tech Guild will ratify.”

New York Times Tech Workers Go on Strike
The Times Tech Guild represents more than 600 software developers and others who run the back-end systems behind The Times’s digital operation.

Updated 11:27 a.m. ET
The Times Tech Guild, which represents workers like software developers and data analysts at The New York Times, went on strike early Monday, just ahead of the busy Election Day news period.
The two sides negotiated until late Sunday. The sticking points in recent days were over whether they could get a “just cause” provision in their contract, which means workers can be terminated only for misconduct or another such reason; pay increases and pay equity; and return-to-office policies.
Times management said in an email to workers on Sunday that it had offered a 2.5 percent annual wage increase, a minimum 5 percent pay increase for promotions and a $1,000 ratification bonus. It also said that the company would maintain its current in-office work requirements of two days a week through June 2025, while allowing employees to work fully remotely for three weeks per year.
The guild said in a statement that its members would protest daily outside the company’s headquarters starting at 9 a.m. on Monday.
“They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labor on the picket line,” Kathy Zhang, the guild’s unit chair, said in the statement. “Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract across the finish line.”
The guild said it was asking readers to honor its digital picket line by not playing Times Games products, such as Wordle, and not using the Cooking app. It added that it had filed numerous unfair labor practice charges against The Times with the National Labor Relations Board over the company’s return-to-office mandates and its attempts to interrogate members about their intentions to strike.
Hannah Yang, the company’s chief growth and customer officer, and Jason Sobel, its chief technology officer, said in an email to the tech workers on Sunday night that management had “a strong offer on the table.”
“We are disappointed that the Tech Guild leadership is attempting to jeopardize our journalistic mission at this critical time,” they said in the email, a copy of which was obtained by The Times.
The Times Tech Guild, the country’s biggest union of tech workers with collective bargaining rights, was certified in a National Labor Relations Board election in March 2022. It has been negotiating for a contract since then.
The union voted on Sept. 10 to authorize the strike with the intention of walking off the job around Election Day, when a jump in readership is expected. The union’s more than 600 members maintain the back-end systems running The Times’s digital operation.
A Times spokeswoman said that the company had “robust plans in place to ensure that we are able to fulfill our mission and serve our readers.”
Many New York Times workers are represented by other unions. Times reporters and some editors are part of the Times Guild, while a number of workers at Wirecutter, The Times’s product review website, are also unionized. Those unions, as well as the Times Tech Guild, are affiliated with the News Guild of New York.
Wirecutter Union workers went on a five-day walkout in 2021 over the prime Black Friday shopping weekend to pressure management to agree to a contract. Times reporters and editors held a 24-hour strike in December 2022 over contract negotiations.

NEW YORK TIMES TECH GUILD WALKS OFF THE JOB
Workers who power all NYT technology - including mobile push alerts, app & website maintenance and the ‘election needle’ - begin ULP strike, threatening to be the first NewsGuild work stoppage to coincide with a presidential election day in 60 years.
11/04/2024
NEW YORK – The Times Tech Guild – the union that powers the technology behind election coverage at The New York Times – has walked off the job in a ULP strike that threatens Election Day. 
The work stoppage began at 12:01 a.m. ET Monday despite multiple rounds of intense bargaining and a practice picket that drew more than 400 outside the headquarters of The Times and another 200 remotely on Wednesday.
Tech Guild members will begin picketing at 9 a.m. outside the Eighth Avenue entrance of The New York Times. The picket line will run 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. 
The Tech Guild is asking readers to honor the digital picket line and not play popular NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections as well as not use the NYT Cooking app. Members of the newsroom union, Times Guild, have pledged not to do struck work, a right that’s protected under their contract. 
Despite the risk of a Tech Guild ULP strike disrupting access to news during the presidential election, management has failed to meaningfully address tech workers’ key concerns such as  remote/hybrid work protections; “just cause” job protections, which the newsroom union has had for decades; limits on subcontracting; and pay equity/fair pay. 
Throughout the bargaining process, Times management has engaged in numerous labor law violations, including implementing return-to-office mandates without bargaining and attempting to intimidate members through interrogations about their strike intentions. The NewsGuild of NY has filed unfair labor practice charges against The Times on these tactics as well as numerous other violations of labor law. 
“Our union members and bargaining committee have done everything possible to avoid this ULP strike,” said Kathy Zhang, a Senior Analytics Manager at The New York Times and unit chair of the Tech Guild. “But management is more willing to risk our election coverage than they are to agree to a fair deal with its workers. They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labor on the picket line. Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract done.” 
If no progress is made Monday and the ULP strike continues, it will be the first to coincide with a presidential election in the NewsGuild since the 1964 Detroit Newspaper Strike.  
“This ULP strike by tech workers at The New York Times is a direct result of management’s decision to undervalue their labor as a contract negotiation strategy,” said Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York. “We have been sounding the alarm for weeks and cleared our schedules to get this contract done before the election week deadline. As workers and subscribers, we’re disheartened that the Times is willing to gamble with its election coverage to avoid agreeing to a fair and just contract. We remain ready to bargain and look forward to reaching an agreement our members at Times Tech Guild will ratify.”

GPT-4o mini

Both articles discuss the strike by the Times Tech Guild, representing over 600 tech workers at The New York Times, but they differ in focus, detail, and tone.

### Similarities:
1. **Strike Announcement**: Both articles report on the strike initiated by the Times Tech Guild, highlighting the timing just before Election Day, which is a critical period for news coverage.
2. **Key Issues**: They mention the main sticking points in negotiations, including the demand for a "just cause" provision, pay increases, pay equity, and return-to-office policies.
3. **Management's Position**: Both articles include statements from Times management, emphasizing their perspective on the negotiations and the offers made to the workers.
4. **Picketing Details**: They provide information about the picketing schedule and the guild's call for readers to honor the digital picket line by refraining from using certain NYT products.

### Differences:
1. **Depth of Context**: The New York Times article provides a more straightforward account of the strike, focusing on the facts and management's response. In contrast, the second article offers a more detailed context regarding the history of labor relations at The Times, including past strikes and the broader implications of the current strike.
2. **Tone and Urgency**: The second article conveys a sense of urgency and the potential impact of the strike on election coverage, framing it as a significant labor action that could disrupt access to news during a crucial time. The New York Times article is more neutral and less emotive.
3. **Labor Law Violations**: The second article explicitly mentions the unfair labor practice (ULP) charges filed against The Times, detailing management's alleged violations of labor law, which is not as prominently featured in the New York Times article.
4. **Quotes and Perspectives**: The second article includes more direct quotes from union leaders and emphasizes their commitment to bargaining, while the New York Times article focuses more on management's perspective.

### Missing Elements from the New York Times Article:
1. **Historical Context**: The New York Times article lacks the historical context of previous strikes and labor actions at The Times, which could provide readers with a better understanding of the current situation.
2. **Details on Labor Violations**: The mention of specific unfair labor practice charges and the implications of management's actions are absent, which could inform readers about the seriousness of the labor dispute.
3. **Broader Implications**: The second article discusses the potential impact of the strike on election coverage and the significance of this being the first strike coinciding with a presidential election in 60 years, which is not addressed in the New York Times article.
4. **Union Solidarity**: The second article highlights the solidarity among different unions at The Times, which is not mentioned in the New York Times article, potentially missing an important aspect of labor relations within the organization.

In summary, while both articles cover the same event, the second article provides a more comprehensive and urgent perspective on the strike, including historical context and details about labor law violations, which are less emphasized in the New York Times article.

Based on the comparison of the two articles, the key differences and missing elements are:

1. The New York Times article provides more details on the specific issues being negotiated, such as the "just cause" provision, pay increases, pay equity, and return-to-office policies. The new article is more concise and does not go into the same level of detail on the contract negotiations.

2. The new article provides more context on the potential impact of the strike, mentioning that it could disrupt access to news during the presidential election and that it would be the first NewsGuild work stoppage to coincide with a presidential election day in 60 years. This additional context is missing from the New York Times article.

3. The new article includes quotes from Kathy Zhang, the Tech Guild's unit chair, and Susan DeCarava, the president of the NewsGuild of New York, which provide more insight into the union's perspective and the reasons behind the strike. These quotes are not present in the New York Times article.

4. The new article also mentions that the NewsGuild of NY has filed unfair labor practice charges against The Times, which is an important detail not included in the New York Times article.

In summary, the new article provides more context, additional details on the contract negotiations, and more direct quotes from union representatives, which gives a more comprehensive understanding of the situation compared to the New York Times article.

Workers who power all NYT technology - including mobile push alerts, app & website maintenance and the ‘election needle’ - begin ULP strike, threatening to be the first NewsGuild work stoppage to coincide with a presidential election day in 60 years.
11/04/2024
NEW YORK – The Times Tech Guild – the union that powers the technology behind election coverage at The New York Times – has walked off the job in a ULP strike that threatens Election Day. 
The work stoppage began at 12:01 a.m. ET Monday despite multiple rounds of intense bargaining and a practice picket that drew more than 400 outside the headquarters of The Times and another 200 remotely on Wednesday.
Tech Guild members will begin picketing at 9 a.m. outside the Eighth Avenue entrance of The New York Times. The picket line will run 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. 
The Tech Guild is asking readers to honor the digital picket line and not play popular NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections as well as not use the NYT Cooking app. Members of the newsroom union, Times Guild, have pledged not to do struck work, a right that’s protected under their contract. 
Despite the risk of a Tech Guild ULP strike disrupting access to news during the presidential election, management has failed to meaningfully address tech workers’ key concerns such as  remote/hybrid work protections; “just cause” job protections, which the newsroom union has had for decades; limits on subcontracting; and pay equity/fair pay. 
Throughout the bargaining process, Times management has engaged in numerous labor law violations, including implementing return-to-office mandates without bargaining and attempting to intimidate members through interrogations about their strike intentions. The NewsGuild of NY has filed unfair labor practice charges against The Times on these tactics as well as numerous other violations of labor law. 
“Our union members and bargaining committee have done everything possible to avoid this ULP strike,” said Kathy Zhang, a Senior Analytics Manager at The New York Times and unit chair of the Tech Guild. “But management is more willing to risk our election coverage than they are to agree to a fair deal with its workers. They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labor on the picket line. Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract done.” 
If no progress is made Monday and the ULP strike continues, it will be the first to coincide with a presidential election in the NewsGuild since the 1964 Detroit Newspaper Strike.  
“This ULP strike by tech workers at The New York Times is a direct result of management’s decision to undervalue their labor as a contract negotiation strategy,” said Susan DeCarava, president of The NewsGuild of New York. “We have been sounding the alarm for weeks and cleared our schedules to get this contract done before the election week deadline. As workers and subscribers, we’re disheartened that the Times is willing to gamble with its election coverage to avoid agreeing to a fair and just contract. We remain ready to bargain and look forward to reaching an agreement our members at Times Tech Guild will ratify.”

The two articles are about the same topic, the New York Times Tech Guild going on strike, but they have some differences in terms of details and tone.

The New York Times article provides more background information on the union, its history, and its relationship with other unions. It also mentions the company's response to the strike, including the email sent to workers by Hannah Yang and Jason Sobel, and the company's plans to ensure that it can continue to fulfill its mission and serve its readers.

The NewsGuild article, on the other hand, provides more details about the specific issues that led to the strike, such as the lack of remote/hybrid work protections, "just cause" job protections, limits on subcontracting, and pay equity/fair pay. It also mentions the labor law violations committed by Times management, including implementing return-to-office mandates without bargaining and attempting to intimidate members about their strike intentions.

What is missing from the New York Times article is a detailed explanation of the specific issues that led to the strike and the labor law violations committed by Times management. The article mentions that the sticking points in the negotiations were over "just cause" provisions, pay increases, and return-to-office policies, but it does not provide more information about these issues or how they relate to the strike.

Additionally, the New York Times article does not mention the NewsGuild's statement that the strike is a result of management's decision to undervalue the labor of tech workers as a contract negotiation strategy. This statement is included in the NewsGuild article and provides more context about the motivations behind the strike.

Overall, the two articles provide different perspectives on the same event, with the New York Times article focusing more on the company's response and the NewsGuild article focusing more on the issues that led to the strike and the labor law violations committed by Times management.

 The two articles are both reporting on the same event, a strike by the New York Times Tech Guild, but they are written by different authors and for different publications. The New York Times article, written by Katie Robertson, provides more detailed information about the specific issues being negotiated in the contract, such as the "just cause" provision, pay increases and pay equity, and return-to-office policies. It also includes quotes from both the union and management, providing a more balanced perspective.

The second article, which is not attributed to a specific author or publication, has a more sensational and activist tone. It focuses on the fact that the strike is happening on Election Day and the potential impact on election coverage. It also includes more direct criticism of management and their negotiation tactics.

One thing that is missing from the New York Times article is a clear explanation of what a ULP strike is and why it is being used in this situation. A ULP strike, or Unfair Labor Practice strike, is a strike called in response to an employer's violation of labor laws. In this case, the NewsGuild of New York has filed unfair labor practice charges against The Times for implementing return-to-office mandates without bargaining and attempting to intimidate members through interrogations about their strike intentions. The second article mentions this, but the New York Times article does not.
