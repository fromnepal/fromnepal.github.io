I almost feel sorry for Vice President Kamala Harris as I feel that she was pretty much set up to lose by the DNC, but that’s life in the blood-soaked sands of the political arena.

So I don’t really feel sorry for her.  Like the late Andy Warhol’s statement, Harris got her “15 minutes of fame.”  Well, I hope she enjoyed it while it lasted.  Now it’s time for her to make millions writing best-sellers…if they sell, that is.

Anyway…

I remember what Hillary Clinton did back in 2016 when she lost to Trump.  She called former President Barrack Obama to apologize.  She also had some trouble coming out of her room to give her concession speech, she was that upset…by the upset.  I wonder if Harris will also call Obama to apologize, which begs the question, who is Obama that all these people are apologizing to him?

As a demented afterthought, I am now wondering if a duly elected president can be impeached even before he is inaugurated.  There’s a first time for everything, right?  Why not let’s give it a shot…just for the fun of it!
