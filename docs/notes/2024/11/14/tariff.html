        <h1>Here’s How Trump Could Lose the Coming Trade War</h1>
        <p class="muted">Nov. 14, 2024, 7:00 p.m. ET</p>
        <p class="muted">By Paul Krugman</p>
        <p class="muted">Opinion Columnist</p>
        <p>The good news: I don’t think Donald Trump will cause a global trade war.</p>
        <p>The bad news: The reason I say that is I believe that a trade war would be coming even if Trump had lost the election, largely because China is refusing to act like a responsible economic superpower. Unfortunately, Trump may be the worst possible person to guide U.S. policy through the turmoil that’s probably ahead.</p>
        <p>He won’t be the reason we have a trade war, but he may well be the reason we lose it.</p>
        <p>China is the greatest economic success story in history. It used to be very poor; there are still many people alive who remember the great famine of 1959-61. But after the reforms that began in 1978 its economy soared. Even now, China is only a middle-income country, with G.D.P. per capita substantially lower than ours or in Western Europe. But China has a huge population, so by some measures it is now the world’s largest economy.</p>
        <p>However, all indications are that China’s era of torrid economic growth is behind it. For decades, Chinese growth was fueled mainly by two things: a rising working-age population and rapid productivity growth driven by borrowed technology. But the working-age population peaked around a decade ago and is now falling. And despite some impressive achievements, the overall rate of technological progress in China, which economists measure by looking at “total factor productivity,” appears to have slowed to a crawl.</p>
        <p>But a growth slowdown doesn’t have to be a catastrophe. Japan went through a similar demographic and technological downshift in the 1990s and has, on the whole, handled it fairly gracefully, avoiding mass unemployment and social unrest.</p>
        <p>China, however, has built an economic system designed for the high-growth era — a system that suppresses consumer spending and encourages very high rates of investment.</p>
        <p>This system was workable as long as supercharged economic growth created the need for ever more factories, office buildings and so on, so that high investment could find productive uses. But while an economy growing at, say, 9 percent a year can productively invest 40 percent of G.D.P., an economy growing at 3 percent can’t.</p>
        <p>The answer seems obvious: redistribute income to households and reorient the economy away from investment toward consumption. But for whatever reason, China’s government seems unwilling to move in that direction. Again and again, stimulus policies have been aimed more at expanding productive capacity than at empowering consumers to make use of that capacity.</p>
        <p>So what do you do if you have lots of capacity but your consumers can’t or won’t buy what you make? You try to export the problem, keeping the economy humming by running huge trade surpluses.</p>
        <p>And I mean huge. Tellingly, China seems to be playing games with its trade numbers in an attempt to make its surpluses look smaller than they really are. But China appears to be exporting close to $1 trillion more than it imports, and the trend is upward.</p>
        <p>Hence the coming trade war. The rest of the world won’t passively accept Chinese surpluses on that scale. The “China shock” of the 2000s taught us that whatever the (real) virtues of free trade, a huge import surge does unacceptable damage to workers and communities in its path. Furthermore, China is an autocracy that doesn’t share democratic values. Allowing it to dominate strategically crucial industries is an unacceptable risk.</p>
        <p>That’s why the Biden administration has been quietly pursuing a quite hard line on China, retaining Trump’s tariffs and trying to limit its progress in advanced technologies. It’s why the European Union has imposed high tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, which is probably only the beginning of expanded trade conflict.</p>
        <p>So the trade war is coming; in some ways it has already started. What will Trump add to the story?</p>
        <p>Ignorance, lack of focus and potential cronyism. Oh, and gullibility.</p>
        <p>Ignorance: Trump’s insistence that tariffs don’t hurt consumers — even as businesses across America are planning to raise prices when his planned tariffs hit — strongly suggests that neither he nor anyone he listens to understands how global trade works. Not a good thing at a time of trade conflict.</p>
        <p>Lack of focus: By proposing tariffs across the board, not on just China, Trump will raise costs for many American businesses and alienate allies who should be part of a cooperative response.</p>
        <p>Cronyism: The president has great discretion in granting tariff exemptions to selected companies. During Trump’s first term, such exemptions went disproportionately to companies with Republican political connections. It’s naïve to think this isn’t likely to happen again, and on a much larger scale.</p>
        <p>Finally, gullibility: During his first term, Trump eventually stopped raising tariffs after signing what he called a “historic trade deal” in which China agreed to buy $200 billion in American goods. How much of that total did China actually buy? None.</p>
        <p>As I said, serious trade conflict is coming as China tries to export its policy failures. But America just elected perhaps the worst possible leader to manage that conflict.</p>

    <p class="muted">Trump Transition Live Updates: Trump Wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Be Health Secretary</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Kennedy, who ran for president before backing Mr. Trump, is skeptical of mainstream health recommendations, such as vaccinations and fluoride in water. Whether the Senate, even one controlled by Republicans, will confirm him is not clear.</p>
    <p class="muted">Here’s the latest on the next administration.</p>
    <p class="muted">After saying that he would let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “go wild on health,” President-elect Donald J. Trump said Thursday that he would nominate him to lead the Health and Human Services Department, positioning a vocal skeptic of vaccines to wield significant influence over public health policy.</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Kennedy’s resistance to public health measures, embrace of alternative medicine and natural foods and dissemination of false information about vaccines — including that they cause autism — suggests he would openly clash with the agencies he would oversee.</p>
    <p class="muted">Inside the two-hour plane ride when Trump picked Matt Gaetz.</p>
    <p class="muted">President-elect Donald J. Trump still hadn’t settled on his pick for attorney general when he boarded his plane in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, bound for West Palm Beach, after spending a triumphal day in the capital meeting with President Biden at the White House and with Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p>
    <p class="muted">By the time he landed in Florida two hours later,  he had made an abrupt choice that stunned Washington: Representative Matt Gaetz, the firebrand congressman whose loyalty has never been in question. </p>
    <p class="muted">Trump’s Nominees Pose Dilemma for Senate G.O.P., Testing Their Deference</p>
    <p class="muted">President-elect Donald J. Trump’s bid to stock his cabinet with combative loyalists is creating the first major test for the new Senate Republican majority, whose leaders must now decide how far they are willing to go to challenge nominees some of them regard as egregiously unfit.</p>
    <p class="muted">The issue reared its head only hours after Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, won the post of majority leader. Mr. Trump then announced he was choosing Representative Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who was under investigation for sexual misconduct with minors and illicit drug use, to be attorney general. The next day, Mr. Trump announced that he had chosen Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
    <p class="muted">Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, declines to directly answer questions on whether there are national security concerns over President-elect Trump allowing Elon Musk to join calls with foreign leaders. “They’ll make their own decisions on how they want to engage with foreign leaders,” he told reporters on Air Force One. </p>
    <p class="muted">Trump wants R.F.K. Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department.</p>
    <p class="muted">President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Thursday that he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services — setting up a debate over whether Mr. Kennedy, whose vaccine skepticism and unorthodox views about medicine make public health officials deeply uneasy, can be confirmed.</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Trump is stocking his administration with people whom even some Republicans find alarming, including former Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general and Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host, as defense secretary. In choosing Mr. Kennedy, he is picking someone who is at war with the very public health agencies he would oversee.</p>
    <p class="muted">Donald Trump announced in a social media post that he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his secretary of health and human services.</p>
    <p class="muted">Lawmakers on both sides want to see the ethics report on Matt Gaetz.</p>
    <p class="muted">Lawmakers in both parties on Thursday called on a congressional panel to release the results of an investigation into alleged misconduct by former Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, demanding to see its report about sexual misconduct and other charges against President-elect Donald J. Trump’s pick to be the attorney general.</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Gaetz abruptly resigned on Wednesday after Mr. Trump announced he was the pick to lead the Justice Department, shocking many members of Congress who see him as unqualified and unfit for the post. His rapid exit effectively ended the ethics panel’s investigation into him two days before members had planned to vote on whether to release their long-awaited findings.</p>

<h2>Kennedy Could Save Gaetz</h2>
<p>Donald Trump’s nominations of Matt Gaetz to be attorney general and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be secretary of Health and Human Services are similar in the degree of opposition that they’re likely to provoke, but I suspect the intentions behind each choice are quite different.</p>
<p>Gaetz is Trump’s passion pick, and according to the Bulwark’s Marc Caputo he aced his interview with the president-elect by ignoring talk of legal niceties and promising to cut a swath through the Justice Department. Despite all the speculation about some kind of multidimensional chess involved in the appointment, it seems likely that Trump very straightforwardly wants Gaetz to be confirmed, and that the Florida congressman is precisely the kind of figure he desires to have as attorney general.</p>
<p>With Kennedy, on the other hand, the pick feels more like conventional coalition management, with much less personal presidential passion invested in the choice. Trump benefited meaningfully from Kennedy’s endorsement, and those who voted for the former Democratic and third party candidate represent a distinct faction — crunchy, suspicious, anti-establishment, often erstwhile lefties — within the broader Trumpist tent. So the nomination is best understood as a reward for that support, a largely transactional gesture.</p>
<p>Yes, Trump shares some version of Kennedy’s vaccine skepticism. But it’s doubtful that the president-elect cares deeply about the issue, let alone about how Health and Human Services approaches food additives or pesticides or chronic illness; it’s more likely he just wants to keep Kennedy and his constituency onside.</p>
<p>Which means in turn that he may not be terribly disappointed if the Kennedy nomination goes down to defeat in the Senate. He can say he tried, he did his best, and hand out some ceremonial public-health role as a consolation prize. And if a few Republican senators decide that they need to vote down Kennedy but then can’t also vote down Gaetz — well, that might be an entirely acceptable outcome for the president-elect.</p>
<p>And needless to say, this has been a good 48 hours for Pete Hegseth’s nomination to be secretary of defense.</p>

    <h2>An Election Is No Reason to Postpone Trump’s Felony Sentencing</h2>
    <p>Justice Juan Merchan originally scheduled the sentencing of Donald Trump for July, after Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in the New York hush-money case. But after the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that sitting presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for official acts, the judge delayed sentencing until September, pending his review of how the court’s decision affected certain portions of the case.</p>
    <p>At the urging of Trump’s lawyers (and with no objections from the prosecution), Merchan decided not to insert himself into the presidential campaign just a few weeks before the election. He pushed back the immunity review and rescheduled sentencing for Nov. 26. After Trump’s victory at the polls, the best chance for punishment in this case was suspended sentences — probably probation and a fine, but still, conceivably, a short time in prison — to be imposed after Trump is required by the 22nd Amendment to leave office on Jan. 20, 2029.</p>
    <p>But now, after new motions by the defense, the prosecutor Matthew Colangelo has obtained from the judge a pause in the case until Nov. 19 to give the D.A.’s office time to balance what Colangelo called the unprecedented “competing interests” of the jury’s verdict and “the office of the president.”</p>
    <p>Competing interests? Only in the narrowest sense, because it’s not really that complicated. Elections and jury verdicts are both essential elements of democracy; one does not supersede the other.</p>
    <p>On one side, there’s the court’s duty to uphold the integrity of the criminal justice system and the rule of law, an obligation that has never been more crucial than it is today. More practically, why should any citizen put up with the sacrifices of serving on a jury if the verdict will be subordinated to the defendant’s convenience, even if the defendant is the president-elect?</p>
    <p>On the other side, Trump is once again arguing that the president is above the law and that his time is too precious for this low-level wrangling.</p>
    <p>But sentencing, as opposed to prosecution, is not explicitly mentioned in either the Justice Department’s guidelines barring the prosecution of presidents (which don’t apply to states, anyway) or the court’s immunity decision. Why not? The strong legal answer of the prosecution and the judge should be that when a president contests a suspended sentence, it is much less time-consuming than depositions and the other demands of being a defendant.</p>
    <p>As someone who was in the courtroom every day of the trial, I worry that prosecutors may figure that their case is doomed on appeal, so why take all the heat from MAGA world? But there’s no compelling reason to be fatalistic about the Supreme Court, which, despite some awful decisions, has rejected Trump’s position or decided not to review his appeals on dozens of occasions over the years. Maybe his felony convictions will be among them.</p>
    <p>The Manhattan D.A., Alvin Bragg, has already shown himself to be fearless. Now he must press forward — whatever the chances of success — to bolster the Constitution. And Merchan, who respectfully ignored Trump’s attacks on the court during the trial, shouldn’t buckle now.</p>

<h2>Trump’s Choice of Matt Gaetz Should Surprise No One</h2>
<p>Throughout the presidential campaign, I noticed that Trump supporters tended to fall into one of two camps. The first camp — core MAGA — heard Donald Trump’s wild rhetoric, including his vows to punish his political enemies, and loved every bit of it. They voted for Trump because they believed he’d do exactly what he said.</p>
<p>Then there was a different camp — normie Republican — that had an entirely different view. They did not believe Trump’s words. They rolled their eyes at media alarmism and responded with some version of “stop clutching your pearls. This is just Trump being Trump. He’s far more bark than bite.”</p>
<p>But Trump’s selection of Matt Gaetz as his nominee for attorney general, along with his selection of Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense and Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, shows that Trump did mean what he said. He is going to govern with a sense of vengeance, and personal loyalty really is the coin of his realm.</p>
<p>Gaetz’s nomination is particularly dreadful. He isn’t just the least-qualified attorney general in American history (he barely practiced law before running for elected office and has served mainly as a MAGA gadfly in Congress), he’s also remarkably dishonest and depraved.</p>
<p>Gaetz has created immense turmoil in the House. He was primarily responsible for deposing the House speaker Kevin McCarthy in a fit of pique, and he’s so alienated House colleagues that one had to be physically restrained from attacking him on the House floor. He has a reputation as showing colleagues explicit pictures of his sexual partners, and he is under a House ethics investigation into whether he had sex with an underage girl while he was a member of Congress.</p>
<p>Gaetz has denied these claims, and the Department of Justice closed its own investigation into sex trafficking and obstruction of justice last year.</p>
<p>Gaetz’s nomination is a test for Senate Republicans. Can they summon up the minimum level of decency and moral courage to reject Gaetz? Or will they utterly abdicate their constitutional role of advice and consent in favor of simply consenting even to Trump’s worst whims?</p>
<p>No matter what happens next, however, Gaetz’s nomination is reaffirmation that the Donald Trump who tried to overthrow an American election hasn’t matured or evolved or grown. He is who he is, and it should surprise no one that he nominated a vengeful loyalist to lead the most powerful law enforcement agency in the United States.</p>

    <h2 class="muted">Mr. Trump’s Reckless Choices for National Leadership</h2>
    <p class="muted">By The Editorial Board</p>
    <p class="muted">The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.</p>
    <p class="muted">Nov. 14, 2024</p>
    <p class="muted">Donald Trump has demonstrated his lack of fitness for the presidency in countless ways, but one of the clearest is in the company he keeps, surrounding himself with fringe figures, conspiracy theorists and sycophants who put fealty to him above all else. This week, a series of cabinet nominations by Mr. Trump showed the potential dangers posed by his reliance on his inner circle in the starkest way possible.</p>
    <p class="muted">For three of the nation’s highest-ranking and most vital positions, Mr. Trump said he would appoint loyalists with no discernible qualifications for their jobs, people manifestly inappropriate for crucial positions of leadership in law enforcement and national security.</p>
    <p class="muted">The most irresponsible was his choice for attorney general. To fill the post of the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, the president-elect said he would nominate Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida.</p>
    <p class="muted">Yes, that Matt Gaetz.</p>
    <p class="muted">The one who called for the abolishment of the F.B.I. and the entire Justice Department if they didn’t stop investigating Mr. Trump. The one who was among the loudest congressional voices in denying the results of the 2020 election, who said he was “proud of the work” that he and other deniers did on Jan. 6, 2021, and who praised the Capitol rioters as “patriotic Americans” who had no intention of committing violence. The one whose move to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy in 2023 paralyzed his own party’s leadership of the House for nearly a month.</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Gaetz, who submitted his letter of resignation from Congress on Wednesday after his nomination was announced, was the target of a yearslong federal sex-trafficking investigation that led to an 11-year prison term for one of his associates, though he denied any involvement. The Justice Department closed that investigation, but the House Ethics Committee is still looking into allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, improper acceptance of gifts and obstruction of government investigations of his conduct. Kevin McCarthy, the former House speaker, blamed Mr. Gaetz for his ouster, on the grounds that Mr. Gaetz “wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old.”</p>
    <p class="muted">This is the man Mr. Trump has selected to lead the 115,000-person agency that he has called the most important in the federal government, a position whose enforcement role could cause the most trouble for any president with corrupt intent. Even for Mr. Trump, it was a stunning demonstration of his disregard for basic competence and government experience, and of his duty to lead the executive branch in a sober and patriotic way. It will now be up to the Senate to say he has gone too far and reject this nomination.</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Trump’s list of appointments is just getting started but already includes two other unqualified nominations that he announced this week: former Representative Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, and Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense.</p>
    <p class="muted">Ms. Gabbard, who previously represented Hawaii in the House and regularly appears on Fox News, is not only devoid of intelligence experience but has repeatedly taken positions in direct opposition to American foreign policy and national security interests. She has appeared on several occasions to side with strongmen like President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Hegseth, a co-host of “Fox & Friends,” is perhaps even more unqualified, given the gravity — not to mention the budget — of the post he would assume. He enjoys some support from enlisted service members and veterans, but outside of serving two tours as an Army infantryman in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as time in Guantánamo Bay, Mr. Hegseth has no experience in government or national defense.</p>
    <p class="muted">“He’s never run a big institution, much less one of the largest and most hidebound on the planet,” the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal wrote Wednesday. “He has no experience in government outside the military, and no small risk is that the bureaucracy will eat him alive.” The board went on to call Mr. Hegseth a ”culture warrior” at a time when there are much bigger security issues for the Pentagon to be focused on.</p>
    <p class="muted">It’s far from certain Mr. Hegseth could even obtain the security clearances required for the job. He has said he was one of a dozen National Guard members removed from service at President Biden’s inauguration in 2021 because of concerns that he was an extremist — possibly because of a tattoo he wears that is popular among white supremacists.</p>
    <p class="muted">These are some of the most consequential roles in government, protecting the country from military and terrorist threats, investigating domestic criminal conspiracies, and prosecuting thousands of federal crimes every year. Yet to fill them Mr. Trump has resorted to people whose only eligibility for office is an apparent willingness to say yes to his every demand.</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Gaetz in particular has joined Mr. Trump in expressing a commitment to exacting vengeance against anyone they believe has done them wrong. Mr. Trump began his campaign by saying “I am your retribution,” and Mr. Gaetz broadcasts nothing so much as that. He has no business leading an agency with the role of combating crime, fraud, violations of civil rights and threats to national security, among many other things.</p>
    <p class="muted">In Mr. Trump’s first term, the department was protected by career prosecutors and other civil servants who understood that their primary obligation was to the dictates of the Constitution, not to the whims of the president. But Mr. Trump has promised to purge people like that from his second administration.</p>
    <p class="muted">The possibility of extreme appointments like these was the reason the Constitution gives the Senate the right to refuse its consent to a president’s wishes. Last week, Republicans won control of the chamber. Now they will be confronted with an immediate test: Will they stand up for the legislative branch and for the American system of checks and balances? Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have already expressed strong skepticism of Mr. Gaetz’s nomination, and others have declined to express their support.</p>
    <p class="muted">Mr. Trump clearly expects the Senate to simply roll over and ignore its responsibilities. He wants to turn the leaders of major important agencies into his deputies, remaking the federal government into a Trump Inc. organization chart entirely subordinate to him. He recently demanded that the Senate give him the ability to make recess appointments, a way of bypassing the Senate’s consent process when the chamber is adjourned for 10 days or more.</p>
    <p class="muted">Even Republican senators refused to consent to that demand during his first term, to preserve their constitutional role, and on Wednesday Senate Republicans voted to reject as their leader Rick Scott of Florida, who said he would have no problem allowing recess appointments. Instead they chose John Thune of South Dakota, who is far more likely to uphold his chamber’s right to refuse consent of president nominations.</p>
    <p class="muted">In Mr. Trump’s second term, senators will immediately be confronted with an extreme set of appointments even worse than those of the first term. That makes all the more important that they preserve the ability to say no.</p>
