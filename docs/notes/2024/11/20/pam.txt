Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has surpassed the seven-figure mark in her personal wealth, according to her most recent financial disclosure report.

Bondi, a Hillsborough County prosecutor before her 2010 election, declared her net worth at the end of 2013 at almost $1.24 million — a nearly 60 percent jump from her 2012 net worth of $780,871.

Her reported worth was $472,260 when she first ran for office, meaning her net worth over her first term has almost tripled.

She added a significant new asset last year: Her one-third interest, valued at almost $278,000, in a condominium.

The disclosure doesn't explain how she acquired the property or where it is. Because she is a former prosecutor, Bondi's addresses are exempt from public disclosure.

A state ethics law now requires such yearly financial disclosures, but Bondi's filing is an example of the problem it creates, said Darryl Paulson, professor emeritus of government at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg.

The relative imprecision of the form was meant to protect elected officials, their families and business partners from revealing too much personal information.
