in the EU that's kind of at play here
and<00:05:50.840><c> so</c><00:05:51.080><c> the</c><00:05:51.240><c> idea</c><00:05:51.680><c> is</c><00:05:51.800><c> that</c><00:05:52.000><c> Google</c><00:05:52.319><c> needs</c><00:05:52.600><c> to</c>

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is that Google needs to
 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.029 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is that Google needs to
stop<00:05:53.240><c> doing</c><00:05:53.600><c> that</c><00:05:53.840><c> and</c><00:05:53.960><c> there's</c><00:05:54.560><c> various</c>

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
stop doing that and there's various
 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.430 align:start position:0%
stop doing that and there's various

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
and now we're in the process of figuring
 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.710 align:start position:0%
and now we're in the process of figuring

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
out what that could potentially be and

out what that could potentially be and

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
part of that could be Chrome becomes its

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
is right from what they're saying
 

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.829 align:start position:0%
is right from what they're saying
obviously<00:12:17.440><c> I</c><00:12:17.560><c> don't</c><00:12:17.800><c> agree</c><00:12:18.519><c> with</c><00:12:18.680><c> the</c>

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
obviously I don't agree with the
 

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:20.389 align:start position:0%
obviously I don't agree with the
