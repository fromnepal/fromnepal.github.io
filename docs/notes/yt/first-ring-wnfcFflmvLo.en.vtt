here and it's um this was actually like
a<00:00:50.039><c> it</c><00:00:50.120><c> was</c><00:00:50.239><c> a</c><00:00:50.360><c> newer</c><00:00:50.640><c> plan</c><00:00:50.920><c> and</c><00:00:51.039><c> it</c><00:00:51.120><c> was</c><00:00:51.199><c> like</c><00:00:51.320><c> a</c>

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
a it was a newer plan and it was like a
 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.750 align:start position:0%
a it was a newer plan and it was like a
first<00:00:51.920><c> class</c><00:00:52.199><c> cabin</c><00:00:52.480><c> so</c><00:00:52.600><c> it</c><00:00:52.680><c> was</c><00:00:52.840><c> like</c><00:00:53.680><c> a</c>

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
first class cabin so it was like a
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.549 align:start position:0%
first class cabin so it was like a
little<00:00:54.039><c> nicer</c><00:00:54.399><c> for</c><00:00:54.559><c> some</c><00:00:54.840><c> reason</c><00:00:55.840><c> but</c><00:00:56.039><c> the</c><00:00:56.359><c> uh</c>

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
little nicer for some reason but the uh
 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.310 align:start position:0%
little nicer for some reason but the uh
Power<00:00:56.960><c> was</c><00:00:57.120><c> out</c><00:00:57.480><c> in</c><00:00:57.640><c> the</c><00:00:57.879><c> first</c><00:00:58.879><c> half</c><00:00:59.039><c> of</c><00:00:59.160><c> the</c>

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
Power was out in the first half of the
