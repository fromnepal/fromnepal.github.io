00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:34.269 align:start position:0%
motors I think this is how Briggs and
Stratton<00:27:32.880><c> so</c><00:27:33.080><c> like</c><00:27:33.559><c> it</c><00:27:33.679><c> was</c><00:27:33.799><c> an</c><00:27:33.919><c> internal</c>

00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
Stratton so like it was an internal
 

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.789 align:start position:0%
Stratton so like it was an internal
combustion<00:27:34.679><c> motor</c><00:27:35.000><c> and</c><00:27:35.120><c> then</c><00:27:35.240><c> Stratton</c><00:27:35.640><c> came</c>

00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
combustion motor and then Stratton came
 

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:37.630 align:start position:0%
combustion motor and then Stratton came
along<00:27:36.080><c> and</c><00:27:36.240><c> it's</c><00:27:36.360><c> like</c><00:27:36.640><c> well</c><00:27:37.279><c> I've</c><00:27:37.399><c> got</c><00:27:37.520><c> a</c>

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
along and it's like well I've got a
 

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.389 align:start position:0%
along and it's like well I've got a
really<00:27:37.840><c> cool</c><00:27:38.080><c> modification</c><00:27:38.679><c> to</c><00:27:38.880><c> this</c><00:27:39.039><c> motor</c>

00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
really cool modification to this motor
 

00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
really cool modification to this motor
that's<00:27:39.679><c> patented</c><00:27:40.480><c> but</c><00:27:40.640><c> I'm</c><00:27:40.720><c> going</c><00:27:40.840><c> to</c><00:27:41.000><c> patent</c>

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's patented but I'm going to patent
 

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.830 align:start position:0%
that's patented but I'm going to patent
my<00:27:41.960><c> modification</c><00:27:42.960><c> and</c><00:27:43.080><c> so</c><00:27:43.200><c> you'd</c><00:27:43.440><c> have</c><00:27:43.559><c> to</c><00:27:43.679><c> buy</c>

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
my modification and so you'd have to buy
 

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.870 align:start position:0%
my modification and so you'd have to buy
the<00:27:43.960><c> motor</c><00:27:44.320><c> and</c><00:27:44.440><c> then</c><00:27:44.600><c> buy</c><00:27:44.840><c> the</c><00:27:45.039><c> thing</c><00:27:45.760><c> the</c>

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
the motor and then buy the thing the
 

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.230 align:start position:0%
the motor and then buy the thing the
thing<00:27:46.039><c> that</c><00:27:46.200><c> modified</c><00:27:46.840><c> the</c><00:27:47.559><c> the</c><00:27:47.679><c> motor</c><00:27:48.039><c> to</c>

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
thing that modified the the motor to
 

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.310 align:start position:0%
thing that modified the the motor to
make<00:27:48.399><c> it</c><00:27:48.559><c> a</c><00:27:48.720><c> Briggs</c><00:27:49.000><c> and</c><00:27:49.159><c> Straten</c><00:27:49.559><c> motor</c><00:27:50.159><c> that</c>

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
make it a Briggs and Straten motor that
 

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.149 align:start position:0%
make it a Briggs and Straten motor that
was<00:27:50.559><c> actually</c><00:27:50.880><c> really</c><00:27:51.440><c> good</c><00:27:52.480><c> um</c><00:27:53.480><c> in</c><00:27:53.679><c> the</c><00:27:53.840><c> world</c>

00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
was actually really good um in the world
