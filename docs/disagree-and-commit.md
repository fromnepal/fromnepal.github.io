disagree and commit 
----

When was the last time you had a meeting with your team 
where you and your supervisor (or recursively their supervisor) 
had radically different approaches to solving a serious and substantial problem 
and your supervisor `disagreed and committed` to  your approach? 
What was the result? 
Please keep in mind the topic should be serious and substantial. 
For example, if your supervisor wanted to get sausage pizza for lunch for the whole team 
but you convinced them to `disagree and commit` to pepperoni, that is likely NOT a good example.
