OK, so what is this all about? This is basically a place to write blog posts. It's not really much more than that. It's basically just a place to write blog posts and the blog posts are the idea is they are very simple paragraphs a title, as you can see in the Jason and created at modify ad dates, some tags. some tags, but basically. that right? It's literally supposed to be just paragraphs. There's no support from there's no support for basically any kind of any kind of formatting. It's basically supposed to be plain text. There is not even any support to add like lists like list item 1 list item 2 list item 3. There is no list item support or unordered list support. No formatting at all, right? All you can do is write paragraphs if you want to write Anything more than that, then this is not the right place. The. idea is to send everything as a Jason file. So we might be able to use some other kind of front end for it later. This is just. a simple front end for now So Yes, that's it for now.
