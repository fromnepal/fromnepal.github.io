                "So here I'm thinking like this. like there should be an upper band and a lower band when it comes to cooling Um in an air conditioning system. So let's say your upper bound is 70 and your lower bound is 65 meaning that's a comfort zone, right? Something between 65 and 70 so. if you scan set 65 as a lower bound and 70 as upper bound then you can say something like OK start cooling. When the temperature hits 70 or above. OK, you can always set your range to be the same value, right? So you can say my lower bound is 65. My upper bound is 65 and it behaves the way it does today. But you could choose to not right. You could choose to not do that and. then what will happen Is let's say you have temperature like a hot day outside and. the temperature outside is, let's say, 85 And your range is something like. 7277. Let's say, and the temperature outside is 85 Fahrenheit. so you can choose to say Um, I want something where between 70 and 77. So the. temperature Outside is 85. And you want the air conditioning to start when it hits 77 so the. AC turns on its. 77 inside and then it keeps going until it hits 70 right. It keeps cooling going down punching down all the way to 70 Fahrenheit And this assumes that you have a good insulation. So when you hit 70 you do not immediately start climbing back up to 77 right? It keeps the heat out. With insulation You know, closed windows, blinds, all that kind of stuff. Blackout curtains, what not. And actually, you know, insulation material in the walls, like the wool stuff. But basically, we are assuming you have all that and. when it goes to 77 it keeps going. And going down to 70 and then hopefully stays there for a while. Now the AC is off for a while. And what I'm thinking that should do is reduce the number of times it starts and stops. Like pretty instantly. Um, I don't know, but I'm guessing that's better, right? Then to just keep starting and stopping for like 5 seconds, or you know, 5 minutes I don't know. What's also interesting is the temperature outside Is going Over 3435 It will hit 35 on Wednesday And it will go down to 22 at night, right? Um. Pretty interesting stuff. So, yeah, basically, that's the whole thing, right? It's not that complicated. Instead of having one temperature to set on the thermostat, i'd like to set You know, two numbers So there's a there's an upper bound and a lower bound. I mean the same thing, but the reverse for for heating, right? I want Heat to start When it hits, let's say 55 or below right. and then keep heating until you get to, let's say, 65 but then stop. And then don't start heating again until you go down to 55. And then start again Yeah."

                "Call Center is an aspdotnet application. It is an exercise in learning blazor server.",
                "What is call center? Well, call center uses some kind. of simple. technology Um Let's see. How can I explain call center The basic idea is that? call center is a piece F software that people at a call center would use to manage cause basically right like you will get a call and you will do something with the information so it could be customers. It could be patience, anything like that, right? So Well, I'm not going to say patience here, because this is just a prototype. It's not a real application. It's more of A technology proof of concept. So there are no Real in a customer data It's basically just a proof of concept. Um What else can I say It uses .NET. Alright, so what? What technology Does call center right? So call center uses net specifically asp dot net. And even more specifically, Blazer server, right? So we use Blazer server. In asp.net on net We also use Postgresql The implementation of the actual postcrystal server is obviously beyond the scope of this application. But I have The create table scripts. To stand up the post-rescule database on another the server. Um what else can I say?",
                "So one of the main reasons that call center is interesting is that it can basically be deployed anywhere where you have. A way to deployasp.net applications right? The only dependency is like some place to deploy sp dot net. So one place that I have deployed this is at KUS Coos. Um Kus.runasp. .NET Yeah, yes so That's one place I have it deployed. And. It's good to test it on a on a phone also. um Maybe I can make some more separate posts about. what I learned as I implemented different features There is no road map as of now, um. It's just some simple features. So let me talk more about what I did yesterday Yesterday I implemented Analytics on the website, which is basically, it's not very fancy analytics. It's just pretty straightforward, simple stuff where. when you go to a page, I write a new row on the database, right? So it writes a new line in a table called Analytics. And it basically says Visited page by this person at this time. Um and the the default counter so. the counter also has an analytics event built in now. And what that analytics event does is that also says the user click the counter at this point of time. And now this is the current counter value. Um, I've been thinking about whether the counter should persist its value. And I am not sure I'm not sure it should persist, or it should Maybe that should be something I can do. Sweep pretty straightforward right to save this counter value. Maybe I could even use the analytics database or analyze table. To store the counter value. And I confess the counter value later. And I can fetch. Fetch not confess. Yeah, the country value later. The counter value Yeah, not country value. So, as you can tell, I'm dictating this. There's basically no Quality assurance in this blog. It's basically a stream of thought at this point. Yeah, thats it for now "
