                "Rust Rover is an IDE By Jetbrains. I'm installing this IDE on a Windows Server preview machine. This is completely for learning purposes; it iss not for work. Everything I do will be open source if it's worth saving at all. I'm installing it right now. I don't really have much to say except it was interesting that when installing Rust Rover on windows, it says, 'hey, do you want to use visual studio installer?' To install Some dependency I don't remember exactly what I think it was like the Windows Sdk and some kind of C++ redistributable. That's all for now ",

                "Call Center is an aspdotnet application. It is an exercise in learning blazor server.",
                "What is call center? Well, call center uses some kind. of simple. technology Um Let's see. How can I explain call center The basic idea is that? call center is a piece F software that people at a call center would use to manage cause basically right like you will get a call and you will do something with the information so it could be customers. It could be patience, anything like that, right? So Well, I'm not going to say patience here, because this is just a prototype. It's not a real application. It's more of A technology proof of concept. So there are no Real in a customer data It's basically just a proof of concept. Um What else can I say It uses .NET. Alright, so what? What technology Does call center right? So call center uses net specifically asp dot net. And even more specifically, Blazer server, right? So we use Blazer server. In asp.net on net We also use Postgresql The implementation of the actual postcrystal server is obviously beyond the scope of this application. But I have The create table scripts. To stand up the post-rescule database on another the server. Um what else can I say?",
                "So one of the main reasons that call center is interesting is that it can basically be deployed anywhere where you have. A way to deployasp.net applications right? The only dependency is like some place to deploy sp dot net. So one place that I have deployed this is at KUS Coos. Um Kus.runasp. .NET Yeah, yes so That's one place I have it deployed. And. It's good to test it on a on a phone also. um Maybe I can make some more separate posts about. what I learned as I implemented different features There is no road map as of now, um. It's just some simple features. So let me talk more about what I did yesterday Yesterday I implemented Analytics on the website, which is basically, it's not very fancy analytics. It's just pretty straightforward, simple stuff where. when you go to a page, I write a new row on the database, right? So it writes a new line in a table called Analytics. And it basically says Visited page by this person at this time. Um and the the default counter so. the counter also has an analytics event built in now. And what that analytics event does is that also says the user click the counter at this point of time. And now this is the current counter value. Um, I've been thinking about whether the counter should persist its value. And I am not sure I'm not sure it should persist, or it should Maybe that should be something I can do. Sweep pretty straightforward right to save this counter value. Maybe I could even use the analytics database or analyze table. To store the counter value. And I confess the counter value later. And I can fetch. Fetch not confess. Yeah, the country value later. The counter value Yeah, not country value. So, as you can tell, I'm dictating this. There's basically no Quality assurance in this blog. It's basically a stream of thought at this point. Yeah, thats it for now "
