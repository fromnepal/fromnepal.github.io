Apple’s latest keynote brought some exciting updates across their product lineup, especially with the iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods. The iPhone 16 impresses with a powerful A18 chip, improved cooling, the new 48MP camera, and an Action Button—making the base model a strong contender for buyers this year. The Apple Watch Series 10 boasts a stunning titanium finish and cutting-edge display tech, making it sleeker and brighter. Meanwhile, AirPods get a much-needed design refresh, better fit, and active noise cancellation in a more affordable model. It’s a packed release with some seriously tempting upgrades! But not all is well with AirPods Max—and maybe not Apple Intelligence...
