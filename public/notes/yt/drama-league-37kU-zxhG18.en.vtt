00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.360
What's happening?

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.160
Manager.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.840
The computers are down.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.760
Mine too.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.680
Sorry. Tianxin.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.200
I come here very early

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.120
to prepare for the meeting.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.200
Solve the issue first.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.760
Is IT department sending their men here?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.520
Not yet.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.200
Excuse me.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.280
Yes.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.760
Tianxin,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.760
here is the IT guy.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.200
It is you.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.440
I just want to ask,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.200
Stop it.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.880
Computers are virus-affected and files are damaged.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200
We are all waiting for you.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.880
Fix it now.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.800
What?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.200
Fix the computers.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.800
I don't know why.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.040
We cannot open all the files

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.960
in the hard disc and the flash disc too.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.400
Let me have a look at it.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.400
Turn off the Wi-Fi.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.320
Turn off the intranet too.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.960
OK.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.320
How long will it take for finding the virus?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.320
How many computers?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.320
Four.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.960
Two and a half hours.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.480
Too long.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.400
They need to be fixed

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.880
before the meeting.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.720
No bargain.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.040
Take all the computers here.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.800
I am confused,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.840
why are your computers

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.640
and your systems are

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.720
not matching.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.920
Any commercial spies?

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.320
Tianxin sister

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.240
Boss. I am not.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.640
Stop talking.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.520
Don't be anxious

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.600
in the company.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.160
This is not professional.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.720
Done.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.640
Great.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.800
Move them back.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.880
Prepare the meeting now.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.720
No problem.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.560
This is not a

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.560
big problem.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.840
You should update your anti-virus database regularly,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.240
and also the fire-wall.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.000
Good job.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.400
This time is lucky.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.640
But who knows next time.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.240
It tells us,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.160
our company is without

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.840
internet security sense.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.000
You should pay more attention to it.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.920
Who? Me?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.000
Pervert in the lift.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.520
Now you act like a gentleman.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.920
Naive

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.680
What are you waiting for?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920
The chairman is coming.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.920
Now prepare the meeting.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.760
We are planning to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.600
remove the old buildings in this area.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.920
And we will build a fashion office building

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.760
as a landmark in Shanghai.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.960
I don't think so.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.600
We are in a senior stuff meeting of the Jian Gong Group.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.040
Who are you?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.520
It is him again?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.280
Director Lin, I will handle it.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.960
Tell me your idea.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.960
Jian Gong Group

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.200
is a construction company. That is correct.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.200
To build is a good thing.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.280
But here is a traditional residential area.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.040
If we remove them all,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.040
it won't be rebuilt.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.960
Not possible.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.800
Jian Gong Group can do

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.040
this towards the traditional culture?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.360
I want to know who you are.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.280
Jian Gong Group should do

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.280
is to keep the culture, not

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.200
removing the culture.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.200
Allow me to show my slides.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.320
Is it a joke?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.800
To keep these old houses,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.560
the space for Jian Gong group to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.120
build will be smaller.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.720
What do we sell?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.120
Our company won't earn money.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.640
Whose assistant are you?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.240
I believe,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.480
we can build a culture park

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.480
without changing the framework

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.880
and appearance of the houses.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.840
Next page.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.000
This is a project by

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.080
MUJI and UR.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.400
Old buildings, new frameworks.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.160
Use partial changes to merge the whole buildings,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400
and it increases considerably

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.160
the value of the houses.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400
We can use this new concept

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.480
to this project.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.760
Frankly,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.920
you just know how to do business

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.000
by your existing experience.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.360
This way of thinking

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.160
is out of date.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.240
Too arrogant!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.440
Money.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.760
I am talking about money.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.840
Miss Fang. Who is this guy?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.680
Sorry. Please leave this room.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.840
Old building, New proposal.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.840
By my plan,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.440
the company benefit

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.360
will be added on 20% more

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.520
than you proposal.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.360
This is my plan.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.200
Please take a look.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.680
Miss Fang. Call the guards.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.120
No need.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.280
He is our new general manager, Wang Shuo.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.600
He just came back from the US.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.200
I haven't made an introduction

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.440
to the board.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.720
My son will come back from the US

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.680
next week.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.720
He will be the general manager

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.960
of our group.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.040
Please arrange the office for him.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.200
I am Wang Shuo. Good to meet the board.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.440
Wang is young,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.120
and aggressive.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.880
But the proposal is not bad.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.560
Development plan is also

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.480
good but need to be more specific.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.720
We share the file,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.240
and we discuss about it next week.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.400
Why do you come back to the company ahead of the plan

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.080
without a call?

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.320
I don't even know that.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.240
I just want to know the company

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.240
objectively.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.000
Miss Fang.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.400
Is his office

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.480
Ready?It is ready.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.480
Mr. Wang can be there anytime.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.080
Great.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.080
Miss Fang had been working in Jian Gong Group for 11 years.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.160
She helps me a lot.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.160
Anything you need,you just let her know.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.000
I am thinking now,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.360
someone is dereliction of duty in the company,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.320
needed to paid more attention.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.680
Who?

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.080
Miss Fang.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.000
Miss Fang did a

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.280
good job always.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.520
No mistake after the first day she joined in.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.440
Why do you say that?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.840
No mistake?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.840
Three big mistakes he made within

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.840
the half of day when I just know her.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.840
First,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.680
All the computers in the secretary room

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.760
get virus infected.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.520
Second,

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.440
Without any permission,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.360
She just though a stranger

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.000
as a IT department

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.520
colleague.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.520
Today, it was me that fixed the computers.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.440
What if

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.280
our customers come?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.800
Third,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.040
In the senior board meeting,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.200
I don't wear any

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.360
company badge.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.520
And I am free to enter the room.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.520
In my opinion,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.800
she made mistakes everywhere.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.480
Sorry.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.560
Mr. Wang is correct.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.480
He is telling the emergencies happening in this morning.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.880
It is my fault.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.560
I accept any punishment from the board.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.040
Give me a report

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.240
tomorrow.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.120
Chairman Wang,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.960
even though you've worked with each other

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.480
for 11 years.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.640
But by

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.560
this ways of management,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.120
is not a good influence to our company

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.400
that is a public listed company.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.640
We will be at risk.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.160
That is because I

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.720
put you in your chair now.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.040
To manage the company

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.080
in a better way.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.400
Don't be too aggressive,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.160
step by step.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.240
Chairman Wang.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.240
Mr. Wang.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.400
Chairman Wang will have a meeting with

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.080
strategy department in 5 minutes.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.480
By booking,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.080
you have to make another appointment.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.400
Don't you think

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.680
I finish my talk

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.600
to Chairman Wang?

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.680
I understand.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.680
But Chairman Wang had

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.920
finished his talk.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.080
His schedule is full

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.280
within these days.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.360
What if

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.600
you come back at 2 p.m.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.760
after three days?

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.200
Sun. Please lead

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.760
Mr. Wang to his office.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.960
No problem. Boss.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.800
Mr. Wang, please this way.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.520
Miss fang.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.960
Have you heard about

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.680
duty exceeding,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.960
like, exceed your authority for someone else.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.280
I have to

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.120
remind you

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.040
you are an assistant

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.040
to Chairman.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.280
You don't have authority

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.280
to be on top of Chairman and me.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.560
This seems ridiculous and uncomfortable.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.400
Mr. Wang,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.280
If it is really

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.640
happened,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.560
I will pay more

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.560
attention to it.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.720
Not enough, Miss Fang.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.200
You have to get rid of it totally.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640
Mr. Wang.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.920
This is the office

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.920
Miss Tianxin arranging for you.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.080
Miss Tianxin?

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.680
Is it good to caller her like that,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.320
in the company?

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.560
No. It isn't.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.080
Sorry. Mr. Wang.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.760
I mean, Miss Fang, Secretary Fang.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.840
Mr. Wang.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.600
Secretary Fang had been in the company for 11 years.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.280
She is in good relationship with Chairman Wang.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.840
She is his right hand employee.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.840
Who needs to make appointment with Chairman,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.440
or send a message to him,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.440
should go to her first.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.600
She is the representative of Chairman Wang.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.520
She passes the orders

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600
from Chairman Wang.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.120
Why do you tell me that?

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.280
Go back to work.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.840
Please call me anytime

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.840
if anything you need.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.600
OK.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.040
Human resources department?

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.120
I am Wang Shuo.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.800
Give me all the files

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.360
of Fang Tianxin.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.960
That is it.
