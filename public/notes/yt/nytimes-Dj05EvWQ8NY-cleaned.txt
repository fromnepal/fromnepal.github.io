covering President Biden has crossed
what used to be a red line in the US's
support of Ukraine he's authorized
Ukraine to fire American supplied
longrange missiles inside Russia it
marks a major policy shift for the
president even as the US has poured
billions of dollars of military aid into
Ukraine Biden repeatedly hesitated when
it came to helping Ukraine go on the
offensive he's been worried about
provoking Russian President Vladimir
Putin into a wider War but with North
Korean troops now fighting in Western
Russia to take back land that Ukraine
seized Biden changed course the main
reason for the change was a decision
that was taken by Russia to introduce
North Korean soldiers into the fight
this was such a escalation in the war
against Ukraine that the administration
felt that it needed to respond Adam
entis covers National Security for the
times he says the policy change has
divided Biden's advisers some still fear
retaliation from Putin some think the
threat is
overblown overall he says that officials
don't expect that greenlighting the
long- range weapons will fundamentally
alter the course of the war but it will
send a message the sort of strategic
message is really to the North Koreans
and that message is your troops are
vulnerable there is a price a
significant price that you're going to
pay for your decision to involve your
forces in this conflict and the takeaway
that they want the North Koreans to take
from this is uh don't send any more of
them Biden's policy shift comes as the
administration is in a Race Against Time
to Bull Ukraine before Donald Trump
takes office Trump has vowed to limit
further support to Ukraine has said the
war needs to end quickly he said very
little about how he would do that but

hospital where they collected evidence
for a rape kit local police in Monterey
California said an official Complaint
was made a few days later but the
charges were never filed hexus lawyers
say he vigorously denies the allegation
and that he only paid the settlement
because he was worried about being
blackmailed because the settlement was
confidential it didn't come up as part
of the vetting process when heg Seth was
being considered to lead the Pentagon
the times has learned that since the
news came out Trump told his advisers he
would still stand by his pick Trump

a civil case and it's been supportive of
other men who face similar
accusations the new scrutiny of Heth
