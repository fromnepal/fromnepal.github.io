AITAH? I stopped wearing/using what my husband gave me after he said that it's his money (self.AITAH)

submitted 6 hours ago * by swirledletters

I (26f) had been with my husband (30m) for five years, married three months ago. I'm a housewife andI have a little side job so I can buy what I want, my husband has a high paying job that covers the all the utilities and bills. Just a little background, after we got married, my husband insisted for me to stop working altogether since his paycheck can cover everything and help us live comfortably so I agreed.

Last Monday when I got home after I bought groceries. He asked how much was it, I told him it's $950 since he has requests and additions to the list. If not it will be only $850 just like every month.

After that, he got angry at me and told me to stop using his paycheck since it's not my money. I explained to him that I followed the list and got his request. He didn't listen and said that I'm basically throwing it all away. I was taken aback since I only use his money to pay the bills and utilities. I have a side job for my interests and I never ask him something unless I needed it.

I was so angry at his accusation that after that day I began to dig up my old stuff and used it instead and I also stopped wearing or using his gifts. He confronted me and asked why, I only said that I don't feel like throwing his money away, he looked sad and left.

When I told my friends about it, they said that what I did was petty and I should just listen, some of them said that I should be pettier. My parents are reprimanded me for taking things too far. It's been four days now and we haven't talked. I'm starting to think that I really did went too far.

Am I the asshole for rejecting his gifts?

Edit: Since people are asking about why we spend such amount on groceries every month, I would like to add that we have our weekly dinner with our friends and family, and we're usually the host. My husband likes getting those high-quality products so I can cook those 5 star like dishes for our family and friends. I hope you understand.

















































































**NAH (No Assholes Here)**

It sounds like both you and your husband are dealing with a lot of emotions and misunderstandings. Your reaction to his comment was understandable given how it made you feel, and his frustration might stem from stress or a lack of communication. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about finances and expectations to clear the air and find a solution that works for both of you.

































































































Now answer from the perspective of you are the asshole (YTA) but do so politely and with respect. Write a long and detailed answer WITHOUT offending the original poster. Use facts and statistics to support your answer. 

**YTA (You're the Asshole)**

I understand that you felt hurt and unappreciated by your husband's comments, but your reaction might have been a bit extreme and counterproductive. Here's why:

1. **Communication Breakdown**: Instead of addressing the issue directly with your husband, you chose to stop using the gifts he gave you. This passive-aggressive approach can often lead to more misunderstandings and resentment. Open communication is crucial in any relationship. According to a study by the Gottman Institute, couples who communicate effectively are more likely to have a successful and happy marriage.

2. **Financial Dynamics**: Your husband might have been stressed about finances, especially if he's the sole breadwinner. It's important to understand his perspective and have a conversation about budgeting and financial expectations. A survey by SunTrust Bank found that finances are the leading cause of stress in relationships, with 35% of respondents citing money as the primary source of conflict.

3. **Shared Responsibilities**: While you have a side job, your husband covers the majority of the household expenses. It's essential to recognize and appreciate each other's contributions. By rejecting his gifts, you might have unintentionally devalued his efforts. A study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that mutual appreciation and respect are key factors in maintaining a healthy relationship.

4. **Impact on Relationship**: Your actions might have hurt your husband, leading to further distance between you two. It's important to consider the long-term impact of your actions on your relationship. According to research by the American Psychological Association, couples who practice forgiveness and understanding are more likely to have lasting and fulfilling relationships.

In conclusion, while your feelings are valid, your approach might not have been the most constructive. It would be beneficial to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings and work together to find a solution that works for both of you. Relationships thrive on communication, mutual respect, and understanding.
