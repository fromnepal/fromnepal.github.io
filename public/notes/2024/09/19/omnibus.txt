<h2>Israel Strikes Lebanon in Wake of Hezbollah Threat to Retaliate, Officials Say</h2>
<p>Israel carried out one of the most intense bombardments of the past year, as warplanes launched 70 airstrikes, Lebanese security officials said. The barrage came shortly after Hezbollah’s leader vowed to respond after explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies killed at least 37 people.</p>
<p>Here is the latest on the attacks in Lebanon.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon on Thursday, as both countries anxiously faced the prospect of a rapidly escalating conflict. It was one of the largest bombardments in a year of heightened fighting, according to Lebanese officials.</p>
<p>The airstrikes came soon after the leader of Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based militant group, vowed that “retribution will come” to Israel for the wireless device explosions that targeted his fighters and led to two days of panic in Lebanon this week.</p>
<p>But even as the Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah, was promising his followers in a speech that Israel would pay, Israeli jet fighters screamed overhead, setting off sonic booms in what seemed a clear show of might.</p>
<p>Not long after, the skies over southern Lebanon filled with jets, and the booms that followed were from bombs. The Israeli military carried out more than 70 airstrikes across southern Lebanon, according to three senior Lebanese security officials, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media.</p>
<p>The Israeli bombardment was a marked uptick from the daily tit-for-tat attacks that has characterized the cross-border fighting for the past 11 months. But it appeared to fall short of a major escalation: there were no immediate reports of casualties and the strikes appeared to have avoided both major population centers and the country’s heartland.</p>
<p>Israel and Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, an Israeli nemesis, have long been at odds, but tensions have ratcheted up since Israel’s war with another Iranian-backed group, Hamas, began in October. A day after Hamas attacked Israel, setting off the war, Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel in a show of support.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, pagers and walkie-talkies widely used by Hezbollah operatives began exploding all at once across Lebanon, killing dozens and wounding hundreds. The operation has been tied to Israel, though the Israelis have not claimed responsibility for it.</p>
<p>Here is what else to know:</p>
<p>Making his first public remarks since the device explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Nasrallah acknowledged that his group had “endured a severe and cruel blow.” But he said Israel would “face just retribution and a bitter reckoning,” accusing the country of breaking “all conventions and laws.” He left his threat vague. “I will not discuss time, nor manner, nor place,” Mr. Nasrallah said.  He also promised that the exploding-device attacks would not deter Hezbollah from continuing to launch rockets and drones at Israel in support of Hamas.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck at least 100 rocket launchers belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, along with other infrastructure sites and weapon storage facilities. For its part, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for 17 attacks in northern Israel on Thursday. It targeted barracks and military bases with rockets, missiles and drones. The Israeli military said two soldiers had been killed in combat in northern Israel but did not provide details.</p>
<p>Walkie-talkies: The Japanese company whose name was on the two-way radios that exploded said Thursday that it had discontinued that model a decade ago and had warned of fake versions.</p>
<p>The exploding wireless devices that targeted members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah this week have set off a debate among experts in international law: Are such attacks legal? Specifically, legal scholars and advocates are asking whether it violates the laws of war to detonate secretly installed explosives in thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies when it is virtually impossible to know who else might be in the vicinity.</p>
<p>President Emmanuel Macron of France said he called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and told him that war in Lebanon "must be avoided,” adding that “a diplomatic path exists. Escalation is in no one’s interest."</p>
<p>Experts are divided over whether the wireless device attacks in Lebanon were legal.</p>
<p>The exploding wireless devices that targeted members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah this week have set off a debate among experts in international law: Are such attacks legal?</p>

<p>At least 37 people have been killed since Tuesday and thousands of others wounded in Lebanon by coordinated explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies believed to have been booby-trapped by Israel. Those killed appear to largely to have been members of Hezbollah, but also include several children.</p>
<p>“The explosions in Lebanon seem to have been targeted, but had heavy, indiscriminate collateral damages among civilians: children were killed,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said in a statement condemning the attacks.</p>
<p>Other governments have reacted more cautiously. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Wednesday that the United States was still “gathering the facts” about the blasts.</p>
<p>The legal debate is complicated by the fact that while Hezbollah has blamed the Israelis for the attacks and American officials and many international experts say they are responsible, Israel itself has not publicly claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>Volker Türk, the U.N.’s high commissioner for human rights, on Wednesday called for an investigation, saying the people behind the attacks could not have known who might be holding the devices when they exploded.</p>
<p>A 9-year-old girl, Fatima Abdullah, was killed on Tuesday when she picked up a pager that was beeping on her kitchen table to take it to her father, the girl’s aunt said. A second child was also killed, Lebanon’s health minister said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, without knowledge of who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack violates international human rights law,” Mr. Türk said in a statement.</p>
<p>In practice, no one is likely to be prosecuted under international law, given the secretive nature of the operation and the long history of covert actions in the Middle East — many ascribed to Israel — whose perpetrators have escaped accountability.</p>
<p>That has not hindered a lively debate.</p>
<p>Some experts on the law of armed conflict, or international humanitarian law, argue that Mr. Türk’s analysis overlooks the fact that the laws of war apply in this situation.</p>
<p>“Human rights are always present but are superseded in this case by the very specific laws intended for armed conflict,” Gary Solis, a retired Marine and Marine judge advocate who ran West Point’s law of war program. He is the author of “The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War.”</p>
<p>Although it may seem callous, Mr. Solis said, the reality is that international humanitarian law attempts to minimize civilian harm in war but allows for “collateral damage.”</p>
<p>The first question, he said, is whether the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel constitutes an armed conflict. He contends that it does, based  on continual exchanges of fire between the two over the past 11 months.</p>
<p>But Mr. Solis also noted that analyzing these incidents is “like walking through a thick forest and trying to push aside a bunch of brambles” to answer questions that depend on specifics that are not known.</p>
<p>The key questions surrounding the legality of the attacks mainly relate to civilian harm.</p>
<p>Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group research institute and a former State Department legal adviser, said several factors could determine whether the attacks had violated the law of armed conflict or international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>In a post on the Just Security blog, Mr. Finucane wrote that among the factors were whether the carriers of the pagers were the intended targets and whether they were legal targets. Other considerations are whether the expected harm to civilians was excessive in relation to the military advantage, he said, and whether feasible precautions were taken to protect civilians from harm.</p>
<p>“Did this action constitute an indiscriminate attack or a series of such attacks?” Mr. Finucane wrote.</p>
<p>Mr. Solis, who is critical of Israel’s conduct of the war in the Gaza Strip, argued that in this case, the remote device attacks seem to be legal because the weapons did not cause “superfluous damage” or “unnecessary suffering” — both legal terms — and  appeared designed to target individual Hezbollah operatives.</p>
<p>“Were they lawful targets?” asked Mr. Solis. “Probably, based on what we know. But we’re operating in the land of shadows.”</p>
<p>He noted, too, that the legality of booby traps may depend on how they were made.</p>
<p>“In World War II, we’d booby trap binoculars,” Mr. Solis said. “The Nazis would pick them up and they’d explode.” But it would have been illegal to build a factory that manufactured booby-trapped binoculars, he said.</p>
<p>It is a fine distinction but a critical one. “A combatant may booby-trap a camera which is in fact a camera, but he may not manufacture booby traps that appear to be cameras,” he said.</p>
<p>Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., defended the legality of the attacks against Hezbollah, saying they were a “classic act of sabotage.” To argue otherwise, he said in a social media post, would also call into question acts of sabotage against the Nazis, said Mr. Kontorovich, who is Israeli.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch questioned the legality of the attacks.</p>
<p>“The use of an explosive device whose exact location could not be reliably known would be unlawfully indiscriminate, using a means of attack that could not be directed at a specific military target and as a result would strike military targets and civilians without distinction,” the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>There are other concerns.</p>
<p>There is widespread fear in Lebanon that, beyond pagers and walky-talkies, other devices may be rigged. Instilling this kind of fear also raises legal questions, some experts said.</p>
<p>“Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited,” Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, a fellow in human rights at the London School of Economics, wrote on social media.</p>
<p>The Israeli military just said it has been striking intensively in southern Lebanon over the past two hours. Since the afternoon, Israeli warplanes have hit 100 rocket launchers — some of which were ready to fire imminently — and other military targets in Lebanon, the military said in a statement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Israeli military ordered residents of some towns and cities in northern Israel to remain close to fortified shelters. The Israeli authorities normally make this order when they believe there could soon be rocket fire from Lebanon.</p>
