        <h1>Work in Your Own Mode</h1>
        <p>Forget MVPs, SEO, and changing the world. Focus on what matters to you. Market research and user onboarding are often overrated. Productivity is not about being a robot.</p>
        <p>Ignore the so-called SaaS gurus and analytics if they don't add value. Avoid getting caught up in social media trends and unnecessary analyses.</p>
        <p>Build what you want, how you want. Don't let others dictate your path. Embrace your unique approach and say "no" to distractions.</p>
        <p>Big companies have their own challenges. As a startup, you have the freedom to choose your path. Don't follow every trend blindly.</p>
        <p>Innovation isn't always necessary. Sometimes, copying and improving existing ideas works just fine. Focus on affordability and practicality.</p>
        <p>Don't go "all in" if it means sacrificing your well-being. Have backups and a safety net. Balance your work with personal life.</p>
        <p>Build products that are good enough at a lower cost. Compete on price if it makes sense for your business. Enjoy the journey and learn to say "no" more often.</p>
        <p>Good luck, and remember to stay true to your vision.</p>
