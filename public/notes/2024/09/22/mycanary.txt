Sure, let's analyze the provided script for warnings and errors:

### Warnings
1. **Unmet Peer Dependencies**:
   - `@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin@18.3.1` has unmet peer dependency `@typescript-eslint/utils@^7.11.0 || ^8.0.0`.
   - `@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin-template@18.3.1` has unmet peer dependency `@typescript-eslint/utils@^7.11.0 || ^8.0.0`.
   - `@angular-eslint/schematics@18.3.1` has unmet peer dependencies:
     - `@angular-devkit/core@>= 18.0.0 < 19.0.0`
     - `@angular-devkit/schematics@>= 18.0.0 < 19.0.0`

2. **Non-deterministic Behavior Warning**:
   - Pattern `["string-width@^4.2.3"]` is trying to unpack in the same destination as pattern `["string-width-cjs@npm:string-width@^4.2.0"]`. This could result in non-deterministic behavior.

### Errors
There are no explicit errors in the provided script. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Branch Behind Warning**:
   - Your branch is behind `origin/master` by 116 commits. Ensure you pull the latest changes before making further commits.

2. **Changes Not Staged for Commit**:
   - After updating `caniuse-lite`, the `yarn.lock` file was modified but not staged for commit. Make sure to add and commit this file to keep your dependencies consistent.

### Recommendations
- **Resolve Peer Dependencies**: Install the missing peer dependencies to avoid potential issues.
- **Address Non-deterministic Behavior**: Investigate the warning about `string-width` to ensure it doesn't cause any unexpected behavior.
- **Keep Branch Updated**: Regularly pull the latest changes from `origin/master` to keep your branch up-to-date.
- **Commit All Changes**: Ensure all modified files, like `yarn.lock`, are staged and committed to maintain consistency.

If you need further assistance with any specific part, feel free to ask!

Unmet peer dependencies occur when a package requires a specific version of another package, but that version is not installed. This can lead to potential issues or unexpected behavior in your project.

### Causes
1. **Version Mismatch**: The required version of a dependency is not compatible with the installed version.
2. **Missing Dependencies**: The required dependency is not installed at all.
3. **Peer Dependency Conflicts**: Multiple packages require different versions of the same dependency.

### Fixes
1. **Install Missing Peer Dependencies**: Manually install the required versions of the missing peer dependencies.
2. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all your dependencies are compatible with each other by updating them to the latest versions.

### Steps to Fix Unmet Peer Dependencies
1. **Identify Missing Dependencies**: Check the warnings to identify which dependencies are missing.
2. **Install Missing Dependencies**: Use `yarn` or `npm` to install the missing dependencies.

For your specific case, you can run the following commands to fix the unmet peer dependencies:

```sh
# Install the required versions of @typescript-eslint/utils
yarn add @typescript-eslint/utils@^7.11.0

# Install the required versions of @angular-devkit/core and @angular-devkit/schematics
yarn add @angular-devkit/core@^18.0.0 @angular-devkit/schematics@^18.0.0
```

### Example Commands
```sh
yarn add @typescript-eslint/utils@^7.11.0
yarn add @angular-devkit/core@^18.0.0 @angular-devkit/schematics@^18.0.0
```

After running these commands, the warnings about unmet peer dependencies should be resolved. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask!

PS C:\Users\kushal\src\angular\mycanary>



























It looks like the changes you made have resolved the unmet peer dependency warnings! Here are the key points from the new run:

### Successes
1. **No Unmet Peer Dependency Warnings**: The previous warnings about unmet peer dependencies for `@typescript-eslint/utils`, `@angular-devkit/core`, and `@angular-devkit/schematics` are no longer present.
2. **Build and Tests**: The build and tests ran successfully without any issues.
3. **Updates**: The `ng update` commands for `@angular/core`, `@angular/cli`, and `@angular/material` confirmed that these packages are up to date.

### Remaining Warnings
- **Non-deterministic Behavior Warning**: The warning about `string-width` still persists. This is related to the pattern conflict in the Yarn cache. While this warning doesn't necessarily indicate a critical issue, it might be worth investigating further to ensure it doesn't cause any unexpected behavior.

### Recommendations
- **Investigate `string-width` Warning**: Look into the conflicting patterns for `string-width` to resolve the non-deterministic behavior warning. This might involve checking the versions of `string-width` and `string-width-cjs` in your dependencies and ensuring they are compatible.

Overall, it seems like you've successfully addressed the major issues. If you need any further assistance, feel free to ask!
