FADE IN:

EXT. POST-APOCALYPTIC LANDSCAPE - DAY

The camera pans over a desolate wasteland, the ruins of buildings and cars scattered as far as the eye can see. The only sound is the wind rustling through the debris.

We see a figure in the distance, walking alone. This is our protagonist, JASON (25), a young man with autism. He's dressed in a pair of worn jeans and a faded t-shirt, his hair messy and unkempt. He's carrying a large backpack and looks like he's been walking for days.

As Jason walks, we see flashbacks of the world before the apocalypse. We see people going about their daily lives, laughing and smiling. But then we see the change. People start to act strangely, becoming aggressive and violent. They attack each other, and soon the world descends into chaos.

The camera cuts back to Jason, who is now walking through a abandoned city. He's careful, looking around cautiously as he moves. He's clearly been surviving on his own for a long time.

Suddenly, Jason hears a noise. He freezes, looking around to see what it is. That's when we see them. A group of people, all of them looking normal, but with a strange, almost zombie-like quality to them. They're the "Living Dead", people who are not on the autism spectrum.

The Living Dead start to move towards Jason, their eyes fixed on him. Jason knows he has to get out of there, fast. He turns and runs, the Living Dead chasing after him.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

Jason runs into an abandoned building, slamming the door shut behind him. He leans against the door, panting heavily. He knows he can't stay here for long, the Living Dead will find a way in.

Jason looks around, taking in his surroundings. The building is old and decrepit, but it looks like it might be safe for now. He starts to explore, looking for a way to barricade the door.

As he moves through the building, Jason starts to notice strange things. The Living Dead are not just mindless zombies, they're organized. They're working together, using tools and communicating with each other. Jason realizes that they're not just trying to kill him, they're trying to hunt him down.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - LATER

Jason has barricaded the door, using furniture and debris to block the entrance. He's also set up a makeshift bed, using a old mattress and some blankets. He's clearly been preparing for this moment.

As he lies down to rest, Jason starts to think about his past. He remembers his family, his friends, and his life before the apocalypse. He remembers the struggles he faced, the bullying and the isolation. But he also remembers the good times, the moments of joy and connection.

Suddenly, Jason hears a noise. The Living Dead have found a way in. He gets up, ready to defend himself.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - LATER

Jason is fighting for his life. The Living Dead are pouring in, their numbers seemingly endless. Jason is using everything at his disposal to defend himself, from broken bottles to furniture.

But despite his best efforts, Jason is starting to get overwhelmed. The Living Dead are too strong, too numerous. He's starting to tire, his movements slowing.

Just when it seems like all hope is lost, Jason remembers something. He remembers a trick he learned from his father, a way to distract and disorient his attackers. He uses the trick, creating a diversion that gives him just enough time to escape.

CUT TO:

EXT. POST-APOCALYPTIC LANDSCAPE - DAY

Jason is running, the Living Dead hot on his heels. He's not sure where he's going, but he knows he has to keep moving.

As he runs, Jason starts to notice something strange. The Living Dead are not just chasing him, they're herding him. They're pushing him towards a specific location, a location that Jason doesn't know.

Suddenly, Jason sees it. A large, abandoned stadium. The Living Dead are pushing him towards the stadium, and Jason has a feeling that he's walking into a trap.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED STADIUM - DAY

Jason enters the stadium, the Living Dead closing in behind him. He looks around, taking in his surroundings. The stadium is empty, except for one person.

A figure stands in the center of the field, waiting for Jason. It's a woman, dressed in a long coat and a wide-brimmed hat. She's not one of the Living Dead, but she's not like Jason either. She's something in between.

"Welcome, Jason," she says, her voice low and husky. "I've been waiting for you."

Jason is wary, unsure of

"Who are you?" Jason asks, trying to keep his distance.

"My name is Sarah," the woman replies, her eyes fixed on Jason. "I'm one of the few who are...different. Like you, I'm not like the others."

Jason is skeptical, unsure of what to make of Sarah. But as he looks into her eyes, he sees something there that gives him hope.

"What do you mean?" Jason asks, taking a step closer.

"I mean that I'm not one of the Living Dead," Sarah says, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm not like them. I can think, I can reason. And I've been watching you, Jason. I've been watching you for a long time."

Jason's eyes narrow, unsure of what to make of Sarah's words.

"Why?" he asks, his voice firm.

"Because I think you might be the key to our survival," Sarah says, her eyes locked on Jason's. "You see, Jason, the Living Dead are not just mindless zombies. They're a symptom of a larger problem. A problem that I think you might be able to help me solve."

Jason is intrigued, despite himself. He wants to know more.

"What problem?" he asks, taking another step closer.

"The problem of neurodiversity," Sarah says, her voice filled with passion. "You see, Jason, the world before the apocalypse was a world that valued sameness. It was a world that saw people like you and me as broken, as defective. But I think that's wrong. I think that our differences are what make us strong."

Jason's eyes widen as he realizes what Sarah is saying.

"You think the apocalypse was caused by a lack of neurodiversity?" he asks, his voice filled with wonder.

Sarah nods, her eyes shining with tears.

"I do," she says. "And I think that you, Jason, might be the key to restoring balance to the world."

Jason is stunned, unsure of what to make of Sarah's words. But as he looks into her eyes, he sees something there that gives him hope.

"Let's do it," he says, his voice firm.

Sarah smiles, a small, sad smile.

"I knew you'd see it my way," she says. "But first, we have to get out of here. The Living Dead are closing in."

Jason nods, his heart pounding in his chest.

"Let's go," he says.

EXT. POST-APOCALYPTIC LANDSCAPE - DAY

Jason and Sarah are running, the Living Dead hot on their heels. They're not sure where they're going, but they know they have to keep moving.

As they run, Jason starts to notice something strange. The Living Dead are not just chasing them, they're herding them. They're pushing them towards a specific location, a location that Jason doesn't know.

Suddenly, Jason sees it. A large, abandoned laboratory. The Living Dead are pushing them towards the laboratory, and Jason has a feeling that he's walking into a trap.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED LABORATORY - DAY

Jason and Sarah enter the laboratory, the Living Dead closing in behind them. They look around, taking in their surroundings. The laboratory is filled with strange equipment and machinery.

"What is this place?" Jason asks, his voice barely above a whisper.

"This is where it all started," Sarah says, her eyes fixed on Jason. "This is where the apocalypse began."

Jason's eyes widen as he realizes what Sarah is saying.

"This is where they created the virus," he says, his voice filled with horror.

Sarah nods, her eyes shining with tears.

"Yes," she says. "This is where they created the virus that destroyed the world."

Jason's eyes narrow, his mind racing with questions.

"Why?" he asks, his voice firm.

Sarah's eyes lock on Jason's.

"Because they wanted to create a world without people like us," she says. "A world without neurodiversity."

Jason's eyes widen in horror as he realizes the truth.

"They wanted to create a world without autism," he says, his voice barely above a whisper.

Sarah nods, her eyes shining with tears.

"Yes," she says. "They wanted to create a world without people like you."

Jason's eyes narrow, his mind racing with anger.

"We have to stop them," he says, his voice firm.

Sarah nods, her eyes locked on Jason's.

"We will," she says. "We'll find a way to restore balance to the world. And we'll make sure that people like us are never again seen as broken or defective."

Jason's eyes shine with determination as he looks at Sarah.

"Let's do it," he says.

FADE TO BLACK.

CUT TO:

INT. ABANDONED LABORATORY - LATER

Jason and Sarah are searching the laboratory, looking for any clues that might help them understand what happened. They're moving cautiously, aware that the Living Dead could be lurking anywhere.

As they search, Jason starts to notice strange symbols etched into the walls. They're a mix of letters and numbers, and they seem to be some sort of code.

"What's this?" Jason asks, pointing to the symbols.

Sarah follows his gaze, her eyes narrowing as she studies the code.

"I think it's a message," she says. "A message from the people who created the virus."

Jason's eyes widen as he realizes the implications.

"Do you think it's a cure?" he asks, his voice filled with hope.

Sarah shakes her head, her eyes locked on Jason's.

"I don't think so," she says. "I think it's something more. Something that could change everything."

Jason's eyes narrow, his mind racing with questions.

"What is it?" he asks, his voice firm.

Sarah takes a deep breath, her eyes locked on Jason's.

"I think it's a map," she says. "A map to a safe haven. A place where people like us can be safe."

Jason's eyes widen as he realizes the implications.

"A place where we can start over," he says, his voice filled with wonder.

Sarah nods, her eyes shining with tears.

"Yes," she says. "A place where we can start over, and create a new world. A world that values neurodiversity, and celebrates our differences."

Jason's eyes lock on Sarah's, his heart filled with determination.

"Let's find it," he says.

CUT TO:

EXT. POST-APOCALYPTIC LANDSCAPE - DAY

Jason and Sarah are walking, following the map etched into the walls of the laboratory. They're not sure where they're going, but they know they have to keep moving.

As they walk, Jason starts to notice something strange. The landscape is changing, the ruins of buildings and cars giving way to a more natural environment.

"Look," Jason says, pointing to a small stream running through the landscape.

Sarah follows his gaze, her eyes widening as she takes in the sight.

"It's beautiful," she says, her voice barely above a whisper.

Jason nods, his eyes locked on the stream.

"It's a sign," he says. "A sign that we're getting close."

Sarah nods, her eyes shining with hope.

"Let's keep moving," she says.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAFE HAVEN - DAY

Jason and Sarah crest a hill, looking out over a beautiful valley. The valley is filled with trees and flowers, and a small community of people can be seen in the distance.

Jason's eyes widen as he takes in the sight.

"It's beautiful," he says, his voice filled with wonder.

Sarah nods, her eyes shining with tears.

"This is it," she says. "This is the safe haven."

Jason's eyes lock on Sarah's, his heart filled with joy.

"We did it," he says.

Sarah smiles, her eyes locked on Jason's.

"We did it," she says. "We found a place where we can be safe, and start over."

Jason's eyes widen as he realizes the implications.

"A place where we can create a new world," he says.

Sarah nods, her eyes shining with hope.

"A world that values neurodiversity, and celebrates our differences."

FADE TO BLACK.
