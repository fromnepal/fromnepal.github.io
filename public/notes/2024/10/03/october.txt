this list looks kind of short. are fewer people born in october compared to other months? 

Actually, birth rates can vary by month, and October isn't typically the month with the fewest births. In the United States, the months with the highest number of births are usually August and July². February often has the fewest births, likely due to it being the shortest month².

The number of births in October is generally average compared to other months. The list you have might seem short for various reasons, such as the specific sample size or the context in which the list was created.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about birth rates or any other topic?
