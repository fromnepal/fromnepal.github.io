Sure! Here are some technical questions and answers tailored for a .NET Developer role, along with concise code examples where appropriate:

### 1. Explain the difference between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` in .NET.
**Answer:**
- `IEnumerable<T>` is used for in-memory collections and provides forward-only iteration over a collection of a specified type.
- `IQueryable<T>` is used for querying data from out-of-memory collections like databases. It allows for querying with LINQ and can translate queries to the underlying data source.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Using IEnumerable
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
IEnumerable<int> evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);

// Using IQueryable
IQueryable<int> queryableNumbers = numbers.AsQueryable();
IQueryable<int> evenQueryableNumbers = queryableNumbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
```

### 2. How do you handle exceptions in ASP.NET Core?
**Answer:**
In ASP.NET Core, exceptions can be handled using middleware. The `UseExceptionHandler` middleware can be configured to handle exceptions globally.

**Example:**
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });
}
```

### 3. What are Angular services and how are they used?
**Answer:**
Angular services are singleton objects that are instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. They are used to share data and functionality across components.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Creating a service
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  private data: string[] = [];

  addData(item: string) {
    this.data.push(item);
  }

  getData(): string[] {
    return this.data;
  }
}

// Using the service in a component
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-data',
  template: `<div *ngFor="let item of data">{{ item }}</div>`,
})
export class DataComponent {
  data: string[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {
    this.data = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

### 4. How do you optimize SQL queries for better performance?
**Answer:**
To optimize SQL queries, you can:
- Use proper indexing.
- Avoid using `SELECT *`.
- Use joins instead of subqueries.
- Optimize the use of `WHERE` clauses.
- Analyze and optimize query execution plans.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Using indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON Employees(Name);

-- Optimized query
SELECT Name, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

### 5. Explain the concept of Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core.
**Answer:**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class in various ways.

**Example:**
```csharp
// Registering services in Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}

// Using DI in a controller
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;

    public HomeController(IMyService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var data = _myService.GetData();
        return View(data);
    }
}
```
