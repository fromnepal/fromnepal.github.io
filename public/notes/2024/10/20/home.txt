Breaking: Trump plans to cut the cost of a new home in half by slashing regulations so "young people can buy a home again." 

Domo 

Slashing regulations doesn't make the price of homes cheaper. It'll mean builders can cut corners and pump more profit. 

person A 

It doesn't take a genius to realise he never was, and never has been, a business genius.

person B

    It is a nonsense comment, but politically it’s pretty smart, because most Republican voters believe that Government Regulations Are Bad and that they are the reason for…bad things. It’s dumb but not actually the dumbest thing they believe, or the dumbest thing Trump said that day.

person C

The problem is some local government regulations ARE indeed bad. Take a look at minimum setback regulation, minimum parking regulation, single family zoning, and all this NIMBY stuff. These are objectively BAD regulations.

In my opinion, prop 13 is also a bad idea but no politician (including the felon) will say that out loud because you WILL lose votes if you say that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13

So like when you look at broad, sweeping statements with nuance, there will be some kernel of truth in there but nuance is lost in our political discourse.





It sounds like there's a lively debate going on about the impact of slashing regulations on housing costs. Here's a brief summary of the key points:

- **Leading Report**: Trump plans to cut home costs by reducing regulations, aiming to make homes more affordable for young people.
- **Domo**: Argues that reducing regulations won't lower home prices but will allow builders to cut corners and increase profits.
- **Person A**: Criticizes Trump's business acumen, suggesting he was never a business genius.
- **Person B**: Points out that while the comment might be nonsensical, it's politically savvy because many Republican voters believe government regulations are harmful.
- **Person C**: Acknowledges that some local regulations are indeed problematic, such as minimum setback and parking regulations, single-family zoning, and NIMBYism. They also mention Proposition 13 as a controversial regulation that politicians avoid criticizing due to its potential impact on votes.

The discussion highlights the complexity of the issue, with valid points on both sides about the role of regulations in housing affordability and the political nuances involved. What are your thoughts on this debate?











Former President Donald Trump has indeed proposed reducing regulations to lower the cost of new homes. He claims that regulation costs account for 30% of a new home's price and aims to cut these costs by half¹(https://time.com/7020243/kamala-harris-donald-trump-housing-policy/)²(https://flagpole.com/news/news-features/2024/10/16/what-are-kamala-harris-and-donald-trumps-plans-to-make-housing-affordable/)³(https://gop.com/rapid-response/president-trump-outlines-his-plan-to-make-america-affordable-again/). His plan includes opening federal land for large-scale housing construction and simplifying the permitting process¹(https://time.com/7020243/kamala-harris-donald-trump-housing-policy/)²(https://flagpole.com/news/news-features/2024/10/16/what-are-kamala-harris-and-donald-trumps-plans-to-make-housing-affordable/)⁴(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-harris-ll-fix-high-050500164.html).

However, the effectiveness of such measures is debated. Critics argue that while reducing regulations might lower some costs, it could also lead to lower construction standards and increased profits for builders without necessarily making homes more affordable¹(https://time.com/7020243/kamala-harris-donald-trump-housing-policy/)²(https://flagpole.com/news/news-features/2024/10/16/what-are-kamala-harris-and-donald-trumps-plans-to-make-housing-affordable/). Additionally, some local regulations, like zoning laws, do have significant impacts on housing availability and affordability¹(https://time.com/7020243/kamala-harris-donald-trump-housing-policy/)²(https://flagpole.com/news/news-features/2024/10/16/what-are-kamala-harris-and-donald-trumps-plans-to-make-housing-affordable/).

It's a complex issue with valid points on both sides. What do you think about these proposed changes?
