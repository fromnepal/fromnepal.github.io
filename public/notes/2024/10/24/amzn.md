There are four interview rounds. 
Each has a technical bucket and a behavioral bucket. 



Coding: 
For any coding questions, ask clarifying questions before writing any code. 
Tell them clearly what you are doing and where you are going toward. 
After coding, test your code. 
If you run out of time before you reach the optimal solution, 
let the interviewer know where you are leaning toward. 

## Problem solving: 
Spend at least five minutes asking clarifying questions. 
Try to identify the edge cases beforehand. 
Time management is key. 
Tell the interviewer what you are planning to do. 
Let the interviewer know if you are stuck. 
If you identify a problem with multiple solutions, 
tell them how you are comparing and contrasting the solutions. 
Given x, y, z create a robot that has move method with a string of commands. 

## Logical and maintainable 
The expectation is to produce production ready code that is clean, concise, and scalable. 
The level of perfection is production ready. 
It may not be attainable in the given time limit. 
It is OK. 
Try your best. 
Finish your coding with the perfect code. 
Leaving your code perfect in half is better than imperfect code. 
Code does not have to be 100% optimized but it should convey the intent and logic correctly. 
Be familiar with object oriented best practices and abstract helping method to help extend your code. 
Implement a customer service call dispatch. 

## Data structures 
Know the strengths and weaknesses of any data structure that you choose. 
Could you implement it? 
How and why would you use the given data structure in that particular situation? 
Sometimes you can't solve a problem with a single data structure, how will you solve a problem with multiple data structures? 
Consider run times for common operations and how they use memory. 
Understand data structures in common core libraries like trees, hash maps, lists, arrays, queues, etc. 
Algorithms: expectation is to handle edge cases in the problem we are working with, not memorize/repeat every algorithm ever.  
Understand common algorithms: Traversal / divide and conquer, when to use breadth vs depth, recursion, etc. 
Discuss the runtimes, theoretical limitations and basic implementation strategies for different classes of algorithms. 
Find ways to optimize your solution and find optimal time complexity. 
Example question: How would you remove duplicates from a given array in Java?
