AITA for calling my parents selfish for having me, knowing they’d pass down a hereditary illness, and going LC after they hid it, putting my child at risk too? (self.AITAH)
submitted 9 hours ago * by Quirky_Background838
Edit: most of you figured it out anyway. It is Huntingtons.
I (28F) recently found out I have a serious hereditary illness that’s going to screw up my life, and I am so mad I can barely type this out. It’s a degenerative illness, no cure, nothing. My body’s just gonna slowly get worse. And the kicker? My parents have known this could happen my whole life and never said a damn word.
This illness runs in my family. My dad’s mom had it. His sister—my aunt—died from it a few years ago. I was living overseas when she passed, and my parents told me it was cancer. Cancer. They lied right to my face. It wasn’t until I got diagnosed that they finally came clean and admitted she had the same illness I do. When I confronted them, my dad wouldn’t even give me a straight answer. I asked if he had it too, and he dodged every single question, acting like I was overreacting.
My mom, on the other hand, tried to justify it by saying they didn’t want me “living in fear.” Are you kidding me? I could have been prepared! Instead, they chose to let me walk into this blind. And here’s where it gets worse—I have a 2-year-old son. My child might have this, and they never told me I was at risk. I could’ve had him tested, made informed decisions, anything. But no, they took that from me, and now I live in constant fear for him too.
Then my mom had the nerve to ask me if I would have rather not been born than deal with this. Can you believe that? She turned it around on me, like I’m the monster for even thinking it. And you know what? Yes, I said it. Yes, I would rather not have been born than deal with this disease. They made a selfish choice, and now I’m paying for it. They knew the risks and did it anyway, for themselves. They wanted kids, and now I’m stuck with this. I called them selfish, and I meant every word.
Now, they’re begging me not to tell my younger siblings. They don’t know about this yet, haven’t been tested, and my parents want to keep it that way. They’re hoping they’ll get lucky, but I’m not going to lie to them. I refuse to let them be blindsided like I was. They deserve to know the truth.
I’ve gone low contact with my parents. I can’t stand to even think about them right now. My mom keeps trying to guilt-trip me, saying they were “just trying to protect me.” Protect me from what? The truth? No, they weren’t protecting me. They were protecting themselves, from the guilt of knowing they passed this on, and now they want me to protect them too. But I won’t. I love my son and my siblings too much to lie to them.

Sounds like our family and Huntingtons disease. We’re praying that the last children that have it don’t have any kids. It has decimated a chunk of my mom’s side of the family.

I was just thinking that this is literally my life. Known history of family illness, parents took the gamble anyway, decided to have FOUR children. I have three healthy siblings, and I am going to die. My siblings have already taken measures to make sure that they will not pass this down, it ends with our generation. None of us in good conscience can have children. Parents didn’t fess up until they had already doomed one infant with the more aggressive form. Monstrously selfish, I will never forgive them.

With Huntingtons, even that's probably not a good idea, because then when the parent succumbs to the disease, it's a VERY difficult life for that child.

[–]Huge_Green8628 10 points 59 minutes ago 

I do apologize for the confusion, I do not have Huntington’s like OP, it is a different genetic disorder. Huntington’s is a dominant genetic disease, mine is recessive. You have to inherit it from both parents.

Huntington's and many other hereditary illnesses can be tested for with an amniocentesis early in pregnancy. The blastocysts can also be tested under IVF. It's more expensive than natural conception, but you can guarantee you have a baby who does not carry the gene(s).

This was not an option a couple generations ago and was cutting edge one generation ago, so our parents did not have as many options as today's new parents do.

I think this was OP’s parents’ real hope - they were trying to guarantee themselves grandchildren. That’s the only (incredibly shitty and selfish) reason I can think of to not tell your children about something like this. They didn’t want to scare them away from having their own children.

Exactly, there was a couple here in Australia whose son had a genetic disease and the mum was a carrier so for their second child they used an egg donor. Their child was one of the first to have his genome sequenced or something like that. I read their book about it but I’ll have to add the details later if I find them

[–]MediumSympathy 368 points 4 hours ago 

Another selfish possibility is that maybe dad wanted to keep his own head in the sand. If he has chosen not to get tested himself and doesn't have symptoms, he might not have known for sure that he was a carrier until OP got diagnosed.

He could have been hiding it from his kids because he was afraid that if they got tested then he would find out or guess the results, and that might tell him something he didn't want to know about himself. 

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]br_612 373 points 2 hours ago 

It’s Huntington’s (idk when OP edited to add that) there is no carrier. It’s autosomal dominant, if you have the mutation you have the disease.

He has it and it will more than likely kill him unless he gets hit by a bus first. And if symptoms haven’t shown up yet, they will soon. Some probably have, just maybe not the characteristic chorea yet so he can keep lying to everyone.

Each of OP’s siblings has a 50/50 chance of having it too. OP needs to tell them before they have biological children.

Huntington’s is particularly nasty as the mutation, which is a repeated section in the gene, tends to get bigger over the generations (as in more and more repeats), which can mean earlier onset. OP is right to want to stop it with her generation. Fingers crossed her son is spared (but it’s clear OP is going to inform him, so he’ll know to be tested before having children).

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]MediumSympathy 16 points 2 hours ago 

I think you can call him a carrier until he develops symptoms. I know his chances of not developing symptoms are very very low, but it's not totally impossible depending on how many repeats he actually has.

Whatever word you use, the main point is that he knows for sure he has the faulty allele, which might have been what he was trying to avoid. If that's true it was still selfish to put his fear or wish for ignorance over his children's right to make informed choices, but I do have a teensy bit of sympathy. As soon as any of his children found out they had the mutation then I think he would inevitably have found out. Even if he said he didn't want to know the results of their tests it would be very hard to keep that a secret in the long term.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]magicalmoonwitch 9 points 43 minutes ago 

Not a carrier just asymptomatic or dormant at present I think would be the better description for op.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]LibrarianPhysical580 8 points 1 hour ago 

That part has me confused.  Because this is autosomal dominant disease, to inherit it, one of your parents MUST have the disease.  And that doesn't seem to he the case here.  

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Raccoonholdingaknife 50 points 1 hour ago 

no it makes sense because the dad has it. the diagnosis and severely is based on number of CAG repeats on a certain gene. More you have, the worse it is. When a mom passes it on to her children, they typically inherit the same amount of repeats. When a dad passes it on to his kids it is unstable and often is worse than in the previous generation. It is possible he has a less severe diagnosis that is by nature and by chance is taking longer to set in.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]normal3catsago 31 points 1 hour ago 

Was about to say this--HD is unstable and it is entirely possible for a child to be diagnosed before the parent.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]grubas 40 points 1 hour ago 

Huntingtons has a particularly mean genetic bent, and it hates women.  

Men often have less, later, and fewer symptoms.  

Maternal H is normally "stable" in the sense that it will be roughly similar from generation to generation, Paternal is far less stable.

Even if he wouldn't have picked a different partner, it's a huge benefit to go into something like this with your eyes wide open. Knowing what you signed up for, knowing what's coming next and having the chance to properly plan is sometimes the only small comfort a loved one has in situations like this.

It's incredibly cruel to take that away.

My fiancé (now husband) chose to stay. I was diagnosed (multiple sclerosis) about 8 months before our wedding. I told him I would understand if he didn’t want to get married, he was 24 at the time (I was 29) and we had no idea what living with MS would mean for either of us. He said he would stay, but would think about it before giving his final decision.

He came back a couple of weeks later and said his decision was unchanged. Had our 10 year wedding anniversary this summer. MS has severely impacted our lives, but he always says he wouldn’t choose it any other way if that means keeping me as his wife.

Huntington's is autosomal dominant, so if it's OP's dad's side and the mom is unaffected, half of the siblings are expected to be affected. Same for OPs son. He needs to be tested immediately.

It was very negligent of the dad to father children. Mom should have used donor sperm or not had kids.

If Op's son is affected, he can have kids if they do IVF PGT-M to detect it and use unaffected embryos.

OP has every right to be very angry. This type of diagnosis could have been stopped.

I got this far into the thread before even making this connection...

Not only did they F OP by hiding a degenerative disease from her, they also risked blinking out of their kids' lives and the kids wouldn't know why, as they haven't been told.

I was already on the "jeez these parents are assholes"-train but it just rolled over some puppies.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]mads-80 990 points 7 hours ago 

The worst is OP will likely (I'm so sorry) leave her child an orphan by the time he's 20. If she's diagnosed, it's likely because she's already symptomatic and life expectancy is estimated from onset of symptoms. The average is 15-18 years, but can be as little as 5.

Not to mention the fact that for most of that time, she will be increasingly disabled until she needs round-the-clock care, likely having to live in a care home. They left that for a teenager to deal with, if he's even that old at the time.

That's a selfishness beyond any comprehension.

I didnt have anxiety before having a kid. I had accepted I could die at anytime and I wasn't afraid of it (due to events in life). After having a child it's like my whole world is anxiety. If they aren't close I cant help but imagine the worst possible scenario. The thought of dying now scares the shit out of me because it would leave them without one of their parents. I can't imagine having a genetic disease like Huntingtons and still having kids. The toll that would take on me would ruin me fully. Every day worrying with cause about leaving them early. Its bad enough when it's just anxiety fueled bullshit, having it based in truth... fuck that.

Hard to choose really. I was told, wrongly, that I might have a few years yet before a more competent doc explained you can live to 80 with this, if managed well. the first one sucked a lot.

But losing a parent fresh out of college also damn near broke me. So there is that.

I think, in general, either one is about as bad as you'd wish on anyone anyway, and the other one is just more shit piled on.

I feel sad for OP.

If you're referring to Huntington's, you can live a natural lifespan with it, if it never shows symptoms or if they start very late in life. The average lifespan overall is something like 68. But the average life expectancy from the onset of symptoms is 15-18 years.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Haveyounodecorum 125 points 6 hours ago 

It depends on your CAG repeat number. And, that generally gets higher when inherited through the father, as in the case of OP.

[–]Lost-Imagination-995 51 points 3 hours ago 

Not necessarily. I know a family where the mother had 13 children. 8 of those kids had Huntington's, some developed symptoms late 40's to 60's but 2 of them developed symptoms in their 30's and was a rapid progression. Huntington's was only diagnosed when the mother was in late 60's, so all her kids had gone on to have children and then they had children. One of her grandchildren is my age and I knew in our early 40's that she had it, and now 13 yrs later requires all round care.

To be fair though, if you can't afford that, you probably can't afford the situation you'd have raising a child if the parent with the disease dies while the child is still a dependent, on top of medical care as the parent declines.

But then those children will be born to parents who will deteriorate and die young. Possibly before the children are grown up themselves.

Huntingtons is autosomal dominant so if you have the faulty gene you WILL get the disease. If you don’t have the faulty gene you can’t pass it on anyway so no need for IVF.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]anodynified 217 points 6 hours ago 

Slightly worse than most dominant diseases, Huntington's is also the archetypal example of a condition with genetic anticipation.

Basically, the genetic cause of Huntington's is a triplet repeat sequence - if you have more than a set number, you will get Huntington's. But the more repeats you have, the earlier the onset and the more severe the disease. Once you have over the threshold for disease, the repeat typically becomes unstable, and when making copies for new cells, more repeats can be added. This isn't an issue for the individual themselves (one cell out of many), but is a bigger issue for their sperm/egg cells, where that single high-repeat cell is the basis of all cells in their offspring. Thus, the children of someone with the Huntington's allele can be affected even before their parents.

This is likely to be what has happened here, with OP being affected before their father (since he is an obligate carrier and has to have the variant). Anticipation can be sex-biased, and in Huntington's big jumps are usually transmitted paternally, while maternal transmission of the variant typically presents with a similar age of onset/severity.

I would say that not all cases of Huntington's occur very early in life and while fatal it's typically around 20 years after symptom onset, meaning the most typical age of death from it is 50-70 years - it is definitely still an early death, but people affected can have families before they even know they're affected.

Saw this with my husband's family. Father made it almost to 60, oldest brother dead at 44. His brother's symptoms were far worse than his father's, while his dad had a somewhat normal life until his 40s, his brother was disabled by 25.

"typical age of death from it is 50-70 years"

Not in my experience -- I've seen this freight train in two (separate) families and I noped when reading above about some living a 'natural life span.'

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]anodynified 13 points 3 hours ago 

Figures are extrapolated from NHS Inform, which quotes typical symptoms onset between 30 and 50 years and usually fatal after 20 years - but it is definitely a widely variable disease, and there are both very young fatalities and very old ages of onset. I meant those as a counterpoint to the very immediate feeling of 'death sentence', and to say that there is a chance that OP could see her son into adulthood (and hopefully further if current trials provide effective treatments), but there are definitely no guarantees with a disease like this.

I am sorry for your experiences, and Huntington's is very much a devastating disease regardless of age/progression - definitely not my intention to downplay that with the above post.

Yes, if she has a confirmed diagnosis then dad definitely has it. Her son has a 50% chance of having this disease too. Each of her siblings and any cousins born of the aunt have a 50% chance of having the disease. She needs to tell all her siblings and any cousins urgently. Hopefully before any of them have kids. She also needs urgent genetic testing for her son. It’s so heartbreaking though because if he does have it he is only 2 years old and is being given a death sentence.

Huntingtons diagnosis and testing can be pretty tricky to figure out (OP should definitely have been told at some point though) but for op's 2 year old for example, should you test? There's nothing you can do to treat or prevent it and a 2 year old isn't having children or making important life decisions yet, if not then when should you test? Should you tell a child when they become an adult? Start having sex? When they can understand mortality? Allow them to make the decision to get tested themselves when they're adults or test them as kids and keep it a secret until they can understand? Raise a child with the worry and knowledge they will die early and in pain? People need to be given facts about their genetics when they are adults so they can make informed decisions but the rest of it is more tricky.

I am firmly in tbe camp do it now and put in a file if you can, because you don't know what happenes next. And information can get lost really easly.

You get in a car crash or get dementia and your child ends in a care of someone who doesn't know you had it,or doesn't want to tell them (like parents in this here).

Your life might crash and who says you can afford the testing in 10 years (no idea if its free for you).

Some legislation is passed that pushes testing into medical limbo ie: you only can test when already showing.

Etc etc etc if/when testing and if/when telling are tew different things to ponder.

I’m a hemophilia a carrier, I’m also in the “test now” camp. I’ve known all my life I was a carrier, my family was wiped out by the HIV tainted blood scandal. I’ve always known I shouldn’t have kids, Id want to know if I was OP’s kid.

[–]bubbleteabob 33 points 3 hours ago 

Same, and that is why I suspect the reason behind the parents desire to continue to keep it a secret. They want grandchildren. My family on that side were very stressed about whether my cousin and I would have children if took the test to find out if we were carriers. There was one boy in three generations who’d not had haemophilia, but despite all those burials they still wanted to roll the dice.

My cousin and I didn’t. My mum was fine with it (she said it wasn’t her business what I did with my uterus or why) but my cousin got a lot of pressure.

For HD in particular, there are rules preventing this. Nobody will test an infant for a condition that has evidence of inducing suicidal thoughts when discovered.

The best one can do is leave an envelope that describes the family history. Fortunately genetic testing is pretty cheap and will probably only get cheaper. Crazy legislative changes can always happen, but the HD advocacy community is pretty huge and strong and would lobby hard against that.

Given how related it is to reproductive rights, I wouldn’t be surprised if testing for HD got caught up in the current trend towards forced conception and birth and abortion is being made less and less legal federally and state level, and birth control restriction is next as the Comstock act gets brought back up

In grad school (Cellular and Molecular Biology) we had to take multiple ethics courses as it related to the biomedical world and that included watching Gattaca and have some very in depth conversations/discussions about the implications of genetics, testing, knowledge, discrimination, etc. This was all happening during the Obamacare stuff as well, so the notion of pre-existing conditions and knowledge of those conditions was also a hot topic, how it related to insurance coverage and hospital treatments, etc. The ramifications of testing positive for a genetic disease are HUGE and widespread, they touch lives in ways that most people don't even think about.

I’d tell the kid as a teenager so they can plan their career accordingly and live life to the fullest. If you knew you had a terminal disease, how differently would you have lived out your 20s? Would you ever bother saving for retirement? Would you move abroad while healthy to take advantage of a non-American healthcare system?

We all make SO many life choices hinging on the bet that we’ll live long lives. If you know yours is short you have the opportunity to make the most of it.

[–]avocado_mr284 10 points 3 hours ago 

I’m slightly different. I’d tell the kid as a teenager that they could be a carrier, but I’d leave it to them whether they want to know for sure. I think it’s important that they can make informed decisions, but for some people, the right decision is to not live as if you have a terminal illness hanging over your head, but to live life as you want. Not knowing for sure isn’t a decision I’d ever make, but I do think people should have that option.

[–]1crbngrp 20 points 3 hours ago 

I agree with the test now camp because this 2 yo will grow up with an, obviously, handicapped parent whose condition will deteriorate before his eyes. There will need to be ongoing convos about what is happening. Without early testing, how can this parent keep this child from fearing their own diagnosis? In this case, knowledge is power. The possibility of having HD can not be hidden from this child for very long.

[–]Deep-Scallion-5838 13 points 4 hours ago 

Personally, if I were to have to tell this to my child, I would probably wait until my child was mature enough to understand the situation (Anywhere around 13 or older, absolutely dependent on the child) and allow them to have input on when they go for testing. They should have some control over this situation.

My family has a genetic mutation in which, to put it simply, we’re at higher risk of sudden cardiac arrest. It was discovered when my aunt went into sudden cardiac arrest at 38, and about half my dad’s siblings have it, and of those that have it, about half their kids have it. I don’t know a lot about it, honestly. What I do know is my dad chose to not get tested for it, and included me and my siblings in that decision. None of us want to know. We strive to make heart healthy choices to reduce risk, but there is so little about this mutation known that we basically don’t wanna know we might just drop dead at a young age. This is probably an irresponsible choice of us, because the family members that do have it are followed and get regular diagnostics to check their cardiac health, but it’s what makes us more comfortable. I’m not comparing this to OPs situation, because Huntington’s is absolutely more heartbreaking and serious and a totally different situation. I just bring it up because I think it highlights that not everyone wants to know this kind of thing, and the child should have some input on when they get tested for the condition.

That being said, OP is diagnosed now, and their child is 2. Unfortunately, with a 10-15 year life expectancy after diagnosis, she may not be able to wait until her child is old enough to understand. She has to do what she feels is right, and that’s highly individualized. There’s no wrong answer for when she tells her son and gets him tested (provided she DOES tell him, because her parents were absolutely wrong in not telling her)

Your parents really failed by hiding that illness from you. Keeping that secret tossed you into chaos and put your son’s future at risk. Their desire to avoid guilt shows they didn’t think about how this affects you. Stepping back from them seems like the right call; they need to face the reality of their choices. You deserve clear answers, not their excuses.

In the UK, I believe IVF with screened embryos is free on the NHS (national public health service) for conditions like this. A friend of mine has a different congenital condition and just had a kid with free IVF screening.

[–]tingiling 170 points 7 hours ago* 

In Sweden, it's not an option for Huntingtons. My sister research so many different options for having a healthy child, and was really hopeful about IVF until her doctor told her she wasn't eligible. She was upset when she told me so I didn't fully understand why, but the reasoning seems to be the same as why she would never be able to adopt; she wouldn't be a present parent through the child's upbringing. The health care system can't assist unsuitable parents to become pregnant.

The only option for a healthy child her doctor could offer was that she get pregnant naturally, have the fetus tested in uterus, abort if the test was positiv. Then just try again and again until she got pregnant with a fetus that tested negative.

[–]tingiling 28 points 3 hours ago* 

At the time I thought it was unfair that national policy would have more input in my sisters decision to have a child than she herself could.

My sister chose to have a child anyway. She past away this summer. My niece is thirteen, she now has no mum but she also has little happy memories of her mum. The last few years were bad and that seems to be what my niece is carrying with her since her mums passing. Now I understand better why the national policy doesn’t assist people with Huntingtons in becoming parents. It’s not a story with a happy ending.

Sometimes I still wish that she could at least have had IVF so that might niece would be at no risk this horrible illness as well. But I think I understand why national policy can’t be to spend money or resources on people you know will not be able to take care of their children. Even if a consequence of that is that some people will bring children into the world knowing how they will suffer. Because you can’t stop people from doing it, but you can avoid spending tax payer money on it.

But right now I’m really focused on being there for my niece, and seeing how all this is affecting her might be influencing my perspective.

The thing that shocks me about embryo screening on the NHS is that parents are only eligible for their first unaffected child. 

Imagine being an eldest child with a genetic condition and finding out your parents still qualified for screening for your younger sibling because the government thinks you're defective so you don't count?

Or imagine if parents wanted a bigger family but couldn't afford private screening, so they had NHS screening for the first baby and just roll the dice with the others? How would it feel to be the second kid and have a genetic condition, and know that the government paid to make sure your sibling was born healthy but not you?

Huntington's was my first thought too. Thankfully we know my grandma didn't have it, only her siblings, so my siblings and I are safe. But it is an absolutely devastating illness and the idea of knowingly having kids when you potentially have it is selfish as hell. Especially since we can test for it (yes, I understand its a long process with a LOT of therapy involved). Make sure you don't have the disease before reproducing, PLEASE. Adoption is a wonderful thing if you don't want to get tested and want children.

Same with mine. Most of my grandmother's siblings have it. The only ones we're not sure about are one of her brothers, who died of alcoholism before the age you'd expect to see Huntington's and can mask symptoms, and my grandmother herself who died of Alzheimer's which again can mimic or mask some of the Huntington's symptoms.

[–]xAshSmashes 6 points 3 hours ago 

There's always IVF if they want children! There are grants specifically for HD actually that will pay for IVF, since you can test the embryos for CAG repeats.

The guilt of passing it on unknowingly is really crushing. When I was born in the 1980s, the gene hadn't even been identified yet, and my grandmother hadn't yet shown symptoms. Now my mother is plagued by guilt for passing it down to her children (me & my sister both positive). I try to reassure her that she did nothing wrong, but it eats at her terribly.

[–]Chrysostom4783 8 points 4 hours ago 

My family also has a history of that. Guess you, me and OP are distantly related somehow. It's a cruel disease made more cruel by the fact that getting it or not is basically a coin flip, and if you win the coin flip neither you nor any of your children or descendants will ever have it. In my mother's case, she is the only one of five in her generation to win the coin flip... and most of them didn't find out until my grandfather passed from it, meaning they already have their own kids. I don't know how many in my generation won or lost their coin flip, because my mother's luck ended up driving a wedge between us and that side of the family and I haven't even met most of them.

The good news is that the advancement of research into Alzheimer's is also showing promising results for Huntington's patients. Maybe the pursuit of one will yield results for the other.

It was available before my daughter was born 10 years ago (my ex's grandfather had it but his mother refused to be tested, my ex and I had genetic counselling to decide if he was going to have the test, ultimately he decided against it, but if he'd had the test and tested positive we would've had to either go through IVF to make sure any child didn't have it, or if we'd fallen pregnant normally the fetus would have to be tested as well)

[–]BeautifulMessage9091 6 points 5 hours ago 

I think so, I can't 100% remember what we were told, but I know there was a discussion over potentially having to terminate, so it must be relatively early on in the pregnancy. I know part of the reason my ex decided against it was how it may affect me with the pregnancy issues.

ETA - we are in the UK so it was all covered on the NHS, but if it's possible to get genetic counselling if there is a chance it's in your or your partners family definitely look into it.

[–]PM_ME_CUTE_SMILES_ 5 points 5 hours ago 

Probably depends on the country but in mine, if your family history means your future kids are at risk of being born with some genetic diseases, you can have a IVF with a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of the zygotes. So they can implant you with a zygote that doesn't carry the tested diseases.

Your parents' decision to withhold crucial information about a hereditary illness not only shows a profound lack of responsibility but also a shocking level of selfishness.

It’s just appallingly selfish behaviour. They know they have risked the lives of their children and grandchildren. And now they want protecting from the consequences of those choices? They can fuck all the way off. And when they get there, they can fuck off some more.

OP, you’re absolutely NTA, but would be if you don’t warn your siblings. My friend’s uncle died from Huntingtons and chose not to have children, so it wouldn’t be passed on.

If someone knows then they can be genetically tested and see if they have the specific genes or they can arrange to have regular tests to see if they are ok

The parents are not only selfish. Hiding such an information equals to crime. If one of the siblings is already sick, while it could have been treated if they knew, then that s on the parents

FFS, all the siblings must cut ties with them. These people are animals. No excuse for their actions and they better pray nobody is sick

This. I am a nurse, and your siblings deserve to know. As long as they are an age that they can process what it means.
I have a good friend of my husband's. Took care of his wife on hospice with Huntingtons. Her mother died from it, but no one knew that's what her mother had and only figured it out after she was diagnosed herself. 3rd world country issues. Anyway, due to this, they had already had children, so of course, he was frightened for his children as well. He sat them all down in their teens when she was dx, explained what was going on, and gave them the option for testing or to wait it out and live their lives with the unknown. That was their choice to make. All 3 have now been tested, and unfortunately, 2 have huntingtons, and one does not. All 3 have said they will not have children of their own, the 2 for obvious reasons, and the 3rd without the disease does not want his own. All are adults now. It was very sad to watch this family go through this, but they did it as a family and supported one another with all the knowledge they could get on the disease. Your parents are awful for knowingly risk this for their children and now their grandchildren. They are selfish. You are right about that.

I would make sure everyone related to the original grandparent be informed. Those parents lost their leg to stand on when they didn’t tell OP the moment another family member showed symptoms. A death from it is too late. I have a genetic skin issue handed down through generations but it’s manageable and not fatal. Couldn’t imagine the ticking time bomb that is Huntingtons.

Exactly! When I found out what my illness was, my aunt did not want to tell her kids (she was afraid she wouldn’t get grandkids, so selfish!), so my mum did it anyway! And good on her! Otherwise I would have done it. (we have two horrible illnesses in my family one I have and the other I’m a carrier of but I can still get ill from that one as well) One of the illnesses comes from both my parents‘ families but they did not know that yet when I was conceived. OP, do it, your siblings will be grateful. Also inform anyone else in the family who might not know and might not yet be ill.

I am so sorry you have been burdened by your parents and how they reacted. They should feel guilty instead.

NTA. My parents did the same to me knowing and Im terminally ill at 24 years old from not being able to or even having the knowledge to try to offset the effects of my conditions. It was selfish at all to breed, at least in my case, and not only that but my parents kept me and everyone else in the dark about it. It wasnt even that I wasnt seeking care/answers. Ive been very unwell and wonky all my life and started seeing doctors for it regularly by 7. By middle school I was very aware something was very wrong and doctors didnt know either so would bandaid slap it all. I needed surgeries and treatments I never got bc everyone denied there was a bigger issue.

My parents knew. EDS type 4, the vascular, and Charcot Marie Tooth disease. My dad told me about the CMT disease maybe 7 or 8 months ago. The EDS type 4 was only found bc they couldnt figure out why my organ failure was so rapid. And both parents knew. You are 100% NTA and your parents are selfish af OP. Im sorry. I also wouldve rather never been born. Ive been either hindered or in outright pain probably 97% of my life after 6 years old and told to suck it up by doctors while my parents implied I was a big faker knowing I was a genetic wonk.

Absolutely unbelievable. I am speechless after reading this. I recently had a convo with a friend about how horrible and guilty I felt that I may pass down illnesses that I only found out I had as an adult, AFTER my kids were born.

I told my friend that had I known about these things, I would have probably never had kids. He thought that was kind of extreme, but your comment solidifies it for me.

Looking at it from the perspective of a person having to constantly struggle, it seems selfish to bring children into the world knowing they might face the same. I don’t subscribe to the notion that any life is better than no life, but I think that’s a hard pill for people to swallow because it borders on the lines of eugenics.

Worked with a woman who had a sister similar in age to her and both women were married to men with the same name. My workmate found out she was pregnant and before she could announce it, her sister announced she was pregnant.

I was so happy for her. It seemed like a dream come true to be pregnant at the same time as your sister who is also your best friend.

But she really struggled through her pregnancy. She had horrific sickness and gestational diabetes. Then the baby was born and they found out it had CF. I know she would have been so happy for her sister but I cannot imagine taking that journey at the exact same time and your sister having a happy and healthy pregnancy, birth, and baby, and then you having the complete opposite.

I suspect we have EDS on my mom’s side. She was advised not to have anymore kids after the first one was born profoundly disabled, but she was prideful and an idiot and proceeded to have 4 more kids. Now 2 siblings of mine died extremely young and I suspect me and my brother will die soon of heart attack. Only one was born normal but her kids both have autism/ADHD so most likely she’s not just showing physical symptoms of EDS (she does exhibit light ADHD traits).

NTA. Your parents actively chose to withhold crucial information about your health, which not only affects you, but also your child.

I would never forgive that. Never!

I have a niece that might have Huntingtons. I love her so much, but I have complicated feelings about her parent's decision to have her knowing what her life might entail. I could not imagine how I would feel if she had been born after someone deliberately withheld information of the health risks to the baby during pregnancy. Angry would be an understatement.

You can love the child you have now, and at the same time know you never wanted to have a child with such a genetic condition. It's not a contradiction.

Your parents didn't just steal the ability to make informed health decisions from you, also the ability to make health decisions about your child. They valued their own denial over the health of your child. They valued defending their own parenting choices over your right to make your own. You can never trust them again because there are so many things they can value over the health and wellbeing of your child, not even related to this genetic disorder.

This is a betrayal, and you no longer have any obligations to care for your parents feelings or well being. You only need to protect yourself and your child. And honestly, your siblings as you know have the ability to protect them from at least some of the fallout of your parents betrayal. I hope you all get support in this. I wish you all the best.

NTA. Cancer runs in my dad’s side of the family; my paternal grandmother died of it. I’m (33F) at high risk for that, and I’ve already battled two other types of cancers. My parents got a DNA analysis done six years ago to see my risk levels and stuff. Back when I was born, we had no idea such cancers are hereditary. My parents had no idea I’d end up getting cancer. They were quite upset and took great care of me. Knowing what I know now, I’ve chosen to be childfree.

The baseline Ivf involves taking sperm taking eggs slamming them together and making embryos. Then implanting a bunch of embryos hoping that some stick.

Screening takes money and time. Many things will not be screened for unless parents are at risk.

It's similar to how in adults if your family has a history of cancer, you know to have regular screening for those specific cancers.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Ok-Meringue-259 26 points 5 hours ago 

So IVF just refers to combining the egg and sperm and letting the resulting cell multiply until it’s big enough to be implanted into the uterus.

There is an optional extra procedure called Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis, performed when the embryo is 8-16 cells big, where they take a few cells and can look for particular genetic abnormalities. They can check both the number of chromosomes, and also the presence of some specific gene mutations. PGD is not a guarantee that the resulting child won’t have any genetic abnormalities, but it can reassure families about particular genetic conditions their children might be at risk of.

PGD is very popular for families with a history of cystic fibrosis, as it involves a single gene mutation, so it’s easy to identify.

Generally, the parents get genetic testing, and this guides what to test for. Many genetic conditions don’t have known origins. Also PGD can set you back additional 10s of thousands of dollars on top of regular IVF costs. I won’t go into it, but it’s quite hard to sequence DNA and figure out if any of it is weird.

For one thing, DNA is too small for us to see on a microscope, nor can we use physical instruments to split it in half and look at all the bases on each side of the spiral. It’s complicated!

My wife and I went through IVF for our first kid we are expecting in 2 months. Our clinic highly advised us to do a carrier screen that checks both parents for ~300 common genetic screens (ironically, I just checked our reports and they didn't check for Huntington's), and if we both came back as carriers for the same disease, we should consider genetically screening our embryos. Fortunately I did not carry anything and my wife carried 2 things.

Even still, there are two levels of embryo screening you can do. PGT-A (preimplantation genetic testing - aneuploidy) and PGT-M (-monogenic). PGT-A checks that chromosome counts are correct (which is what we wound up doing) and will screen out chromosomal things like Down's Syndrome; it will also give you embryo gender. PGT-M will do a check for genetic conditions and would be able to screen out genetic diseases like Huntington's, Fragile X, Cystic Fibrosis, etc. PGT-M takes a lot longer and is much more expensive than PGT-A.

My heart truly goes out to the OP here. What an awful thing to have to go through.

My sister-in-laws best friend died from Huntington disease. She always knew it was a possibility. She tested positive and opted not to have children. Her sibling who has tested positive has made the same choice. They understood the risks and they made their choices.

Your parent’s decision to hide this from you is beyond selfish. You have a right to know. Your siblings do need to know. It’s only fair to them and any children they might choose to have. You all have the right to make informed decisions. Trying to turn it on you and make you feel bad for being angry just takes them further over the line. (As Joey once said, “You’re so far over the line, the line is a dot to you!”)

I am so very sorry you are going through this. 💔

NTA. For those of you saying OP is the AH, it sounds like Huntingtons. Google it. It’s a horrible disease with a 50/50 chance of handing it down to your children. Something similar happened to a friend of mine. Fortunately she didn’t inherit it, but her brother did. Just a nightmare.

[–]PezGirl-5 376 points 8 hours ago 

My first job out of nursing school was on a Huntington’s disease unit. We had two sisters. There were 8 kids and 6 of them got it. Back then they didn’t know about hereditary diseases like that.
If you have the gene you have the disease and there is a 50/50 chance of passing it on. Now let’s say your grandmother had it, but your mom never got tested because she didn’t want to know , but you want to know if you have the gene. If you are positive then that means your mom is too.
It is a horrible disease that can move fast or very slow and hits at all ages. My youngest patient was a month older than me. I was 33. One of our patients kids had it as a juvenile. It is so sad

There used to be no test for it, which meant you didn’t find out if you were positive or negative until after age 50 and after a person decided to have kids but the test exists now and with ante natal testing at the very least it could be stopped from being handed down.

Sweet Jesus

You need to group message all your siblings and give them all the information you have and that they need to prepare for the possibility of having the disease.  You cannot possibly be there considering being the monumental AH that your parents are and letting them and their children suffer from something that they can prepare for. 

If they don't have children yet, they need to know about the illness and make informed choices. 

I would have gone nuclear on my parents and sued them for every penny they have.

yeah you definitely can't sue people for having children! but AFAIK* there’s no eugenics concern in defending your legal right to know your own medical history (unless you were stupid enough to bring it up in your argument unnecessarily).

That said, even if there was a case I doubt the legal fees, stress, and exacerbated family drama would be worth it. How tf would damages even be calculated? I think there's a good chance you'd be permenantly damaging you relationship with your whole family and dragging out the conflict for months for next to nothing. Especially if the diagnosis was unpreventable, it was always possible for you to access the information elsewhere, and the impact of not knowing sooner is purely speculative.

Is it eugenics, though, if OP had the information and simply chose not to have any children at all because of it?

The duty to warn genetically at-risk relatives of patients is one of the most misunderstood legal and ethical issues affecting clinical genetics. The legal doctrines are often associated with three state appellate court cases beginning in the mid-1990s. Since the HIPAA Privacy Rule went into effect in 2003, the duty to warn must be accomplished by warning the patient of the genetic nature of a diagnosed disorder or genetic risk and the necessity of warning at-risk relatives. 

 The parents have a legal obligation to inform and warn their children. 

They are wanting OP to be complicit in this cover up which in itself is illegal and her siblings are well within their rights to sue her too if she doesn't disclose this information 

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Inside-Potato5869 42 points 8 hours ago 

HIPAA doesn’t apply to parents. It applies to medical providers, health plans, and medical facilities. There is no legal obligation under HIPAA for parents to inform their children of genetic disorders. There is no basis for the children to sue their parents under HIPAA.

My X wifes family (moms side) has Huntington's (Dominant gene genetic disorder so 50/50 if a parent has it that the child gets it). It was the Big family secret. None of the 4 kids knew about it. her Grandfather died of it.. But this was passed off as he was a drunk and had an accident). My X always had questions and when her mom started with early signs (~ age 40) she began to do research. Finally she was able to get the story in bits and bits . The siblings all sort of denied it and the Grandma never admitted it. My X was tested and did not have it (that was a lot of work on our part to keep it of insurance records). She told all of her siblings.. 2 of which already had kids. None of them ever were tested, they just decided to let nature take its course. (2 of the 5 have Huntington's and one has died of it)
She tried to tell her moms other siblings but they were resistant to hearing it.
The old ' family Secrets'..not your business.

X's mom died of the disease after we were divorced, 2 of her siblings died of it.

Message to your parents; you choose to let me spread a disease that could have stopped after me. As devastated I am by this diagnose myself, I want to make sure no new kids are born in this family without testing. I can’t stop my disease but I can do a lot to prevent kids from having it.

Her parents are utterly terrible people, I cannot believe they are still trying to hide this. A similar thing happened to a family friend many years ago, they had 3 children, all boys, and noticed when they started having motor problems.

Turns out the maternal grandmother knew she was a carrier for duchennes muscular dystrophy, one of the most horrifically cruel genetic disorders, and had lost sons to it herself before having her daughter. And she didn't tell her daughter because she was 'worried she would never have grandchildren'.

So instead, her daughter had to watch her three babies slowly die as teenagers.

As a mother now, NC would be a blessing to parents who did this, because if it were me I'd be so angry I don't know what I would do.

My ex has Huntingtons and was only told at 18 that his dad had very sick with it, he just thought he'd abandoned him at 12, he then only 6 months later got genetic testing and has it and has so much resentment towards his mother and anger and it's meant that I genuinely don't think he can enjoy life. She also did it out of 'protection'

Not disclosing this kind of stuff early, means you set up a kid to think they're going to have a normal life when in reality they are definitely not, as they will probably have family members with it and also have whiplash if they find out they have it themselves. As it also affects your mental health as mood swings are one of the symptoms, it's also shit because you may have no idea why something is happening and get misdiagnosed.

The misuse of 'all emotions are valid' is one of my big pet peeves.

All emotions are valid means that there's nothing wrong with feeling 'bad' emotions like anger or sorrow, and that avoiding those feelings or shaming yourself for them isn't helpful.

It does not mean anything you do in response to those emotions is valid. The exact opposite, in fact - it means that you need to be able to sit with those uncomfortable feelings instead of immediately reacting to try and make them go away.

The decisions OP's parents made came from them doing everything in their power to avoid feeling unpleasant emotions. They don't want to feel the fear and shame of having this illness and passing it on to their kids, so they make the emotion-driven decision to avoid thinking and talking about it. And they don't want to feel guilt about keeping it a secret, so they convince themselves that they're protecting their kids by not sharing.

They need, ironically enough, to accept that their discomfort is valid and stop running from it.

HELL NO. Call your siblings NOW. There are treatments out there that slow it down, and there's a lot of promise with CRISPR and gene-editing. Finding out BEFORE they have symptoms is huge. It also lets them prepare if they ARE positive for it, and when symptoms show they are ready and know what to do and to expect. Your parents are awful, awful people. If you haven't, get your kiddo tested NOW and tell your family IMMEDIATELY. I would honestly not go LC, I'd go NC. Your dad is going to need round-the-clock care and you KNOW your parents HAVE NOT BEEN SAVING UP TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. Nope, they will expect their kids to take care of them with no warning.

Tell your family. Tell your spouse (I'm assuming you have, but if not, that's needed). Test your kid. And give every single person the link to this post.

Kicker? We've been able to test for Huntington's SINCE 1993. THEY COULD HAVE KNOWN BEFORE HAVING CHILDREN. Period. And starting in '96, preimplantation analysis, checking a fertilized embryo before doing IVF, was possible. IF THEY HAD TOLD YOU, YOU COULD 100% HAVE AVOIDED HAVING A CHILD WITH HUNTINGTON'S.

Yeah, I'd go NC with them at this point. They do not have anyone's best interest at heart besides their own. Know why they had so many kids, rather than just ONE if they just HAD to be parents? Because your dad already knew he had it. And they wanted at least one healthy kid to take care of him when it hit.

NTA Your parents are way off base.

My Grandfather had an inherited disease that shows up in your 40s. He hid it and died. I discovered it while doing genealogical research, meanwhile my dad was having weird symptoms that Drs couldn’t pinpoint the cause. I believe that both my grandparents knew it ran in the family but didn’t know the cause until the human genome project. I had children so I was upset as well. I not only had to tell my dad to get tested for an incurable disease but wonder if I am a carrier that could pass it long to my children.

My Dad was furious with his father (long dead). We told his siblings, and my siblings. There is no cure but people should know before they have children.

Your siblings need to know and make their own decision about getting tested. In some situations they can use IVF to avoid passing the disease on.

I attended a support group for family members of people with Huntingtons, and the question of if and/or when to get tested were a big topic. One mum of an adult daughter who might have the illness had specifically asked her daughter to not get tested. She had seen how her husband and BIL had been affected by positiv test results, and believed that the negative mental health risk of knowing your diagnosis was a real danger. The difference between her and OP's parents is that she knew it was her always her daughters decision, and all she could do was advice her on it.

Your mother knew your blood type, but didn’t your OBGYN run a blood type as typical prenatal care? Especially after miscarriage number 1, it’s standard practice to make sure expectant moms know so they can receive Rhogam immediately after a miscarriage

You have every right to be angry, hurt, and to set boundaries to protect yourself and your family. Knowing about the risk of this illness could have significantly impacted your life choices, including family planning. Your parents took away your agency and the ability to make informed decisions about your own health and future.

Goddamn. Are you my roommate? You sound like my roommate.

So his parents had him knowing the mother had a terminal hereditary condition. He had a 50/50 chance of getting it.

They didn't hide it from him (would have been pretty much impossible with the mother the way she was.) But they wouldn't let him find out until he was about 12, I think, and he managed to talk his dad into it.

Low and behold, he's got it. Likely won't live past 50, give or take a couple of years.

He's told me before he wished the woman had gotten an abortion.

He wanted to get a vasectomy to be safe, but the doctors told him he was too young. Right because a young man with a hereditary lethal illness can't logically choose not to have children.

Moronic Ducking Doctors.

NTA - I have a friend with Huntington. When her mother was diagnosed, her and her dad explained to my friend and her two siblings what that potentially meant for them. Told them it was their choice if they wanted to get tested or not, but asked them to please at least wait until they were 16. (this was almost 20 years ago and they were young). I think they handled that as best they could, they didn't know she had Huntingtons when they were having children.

That is absolutely something you should know and they were selfish having multiple children knowing the odds. For those who don't know, it's 50-50. That's A LOT.

In the end, my friend and both her brothers have it :( she and one brother both have two kids conceived through selective IVF (obviously excluding the eggs with the gene). Like you mention, you could have done this too if only you had known...I'd be so so pissed at my parrents for that. I hope your son beats the odds.

They should honestly have told you, when you were old enough to know. That way, like you said, you could have been prepared and come to terms with your situation. Your partner also deserves to know, that this is your situation. I get that they were trying to protect you, but at some point they should definitely have told you. AT LEAST after you turned 20. That way you’d had a childhood and teenage years without worry.

They made the decision to have kids knowing the disease was hereditary. They should have told you so you could have made your own choices as well. Your siblings also deserves to know to know. Imagine finding out you have a serious hereditary illness and only finding out when it starts getting bad, only to know you could have mentally prepared yourself for it for decades and that people knew about it?!

You actually are validating a debate I keep having with friends/family. Couples who are aware of a hereditary illness, which limits the quality of life of the person with the illness, should not have any kids. Some agree with me and some say I'm an AH for thinking like this. That everyone has the right to live.
Yes, everyone has the right to live and if someone is born with any type of illness or syndrome without the previous knowledge of the parents then yes, of course this person should live and should have the best quality of life they can have.

Thank you for giving us an inside of how a person with a hereditary illness might think about being born with it.

Your siblings, if they are over 18, should know about their potential future and should be tested. If the siblings are younger lets say pre-teens maybe wait when they are a bit older to understand better the illness and whatever comes with it. Older teens, under 18 should be informed as well but getting tested it's under your parents guidance unfortunately.

Definitely NTA here.

[–]CupcakeMurder86 19 points 8 hours ago 

That is also a valid option if a couple can afford it. I believe though that in some countries having selective IVF is not permitted. Although many clinics by pass the law and just say "the embryo was not viable" or something.

Adoption is also an option. Although I'm not sure about this depending from the illness.

[–]Cute-Presence2825 10 points 8 hours ago 

True. In my country it is part of the tax-financed healthcare. I know about it since my friends had a baby with a genetic disease. Turns out both parents were carriers, and you need to get it from both parents. So the parents were fine. When they wanted a second child they got IVF and genetic testing for free.

I inherited Bipolar Disorder from my dad's side. His grandmother, mother, and my older brother all have/had it. Osteoarthritis runs in my mom's family, and it starts fairly early. My grandmother has had multiple joint replacements because of it. My mom just got her knee replaced after years of living with zero cartilage in her knee. And she'll definitely need other joints replaced soon enough. I'm in my mid 20s, and I've already started showing signs of it in my knees and back.

I decided years ago that while I want kids, I will not risk passing these and other serious health issues to my future children. It wouldn't be right, and they would suffer like I do. So when I'm financially stable, I'm going to foster and adopt.

You have every right to be pissed, especially since it could effect your life choices, like having children. What it boils down to is they wanted children, regardless of the risks AND they want grandchildren, regardless of the risks. All they think about is them.

Honestly, you are 100% correct.

THAT is why I always say it is a thousand percent selfish for people with hereditary diseases to choose not to get tested and then have kids. If you don’t want to get tested, then don’t have a child! Stay child free and live in denial. But the second you decide to bring a baby into the world and not get tested then it’s a selfish choice. The baby deserves to know and your refusal isn’t about them but you.

I think I know which disease you mean as the men mostly are carriers and the women get affected more. Tell your siblings because they deserve to know and get your son tested

NTA.

I know a thing or two about Huntington’s and it’s indeed a selfish thing to pass on to your kids.

If you can use IVF to make sure you don’t pass it on, I’m more on the okay side. Although a kid will still see his parent deteriorating and suffering, the child will at least be spared.

But blindly jumping into having kids because you want them??? Noooo!

If you have the gene, your children have 1 chance of 2 of having it too. If you have the gene, you will get ill. There’s no such thing like a carrier of the gene that doesn’t get it.

Have your son tested right away. There’s a juvenile form of the disease with a much earlier onset. You’re going to want to be prepared in case your kid has the Westphal variant.

If I were you I’d call up my siblings one by one and tell them what’s going on. First of all they need to have the choice to get tested and second of all you don’t want them not knowingly passing this on to their children if they haven’t already. They have the right to know. I’m totally with you on this.

I really hope your son’s gonna be fine. I really do! And I’m sorry for you. I’d feel the same way, ya know. Knowingly passing on Huntington’s is a selfish thing to do. And then being kept in the dark about it… can’t imagine how betrayed you must feel. I hope for all the patients that one day doctors can find a cure. But I know it doesn’t exist yet.

I'm so sorry for this.. I would absolutely tell your siblings.. and I'm hoping.. based on who in your family has had it so far, that maybe in your family, while females tend to get it, males are only carriers..

A few years ago my second cousin "B" had a cardiac event on the soccer field.. dropped "dead". One of my dad's cousins "D" was there watching ( D is also B's dad's first cousin, our extended family is close and they live in the same town) D is a paramedic and he was able to do cpr til the ambulance came and he got to hospital, and survived.. had an internal defibrillator put in.. turns out he has a genetic disease that caused right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Tested his parents.. mom clear, dad has the gene.. tested his dad's siblings, aunt clear, uncle has the gene.. his dad and uncle now are on heart meds for ever and can never get life insurance that they didn't already have. So of course that means go back another generation.. B's grandma gets tested and is clear but B's grandpa refuses to get tested.. great grandparents( also mine ) are already decreased so his grandpa's siblings need to get tested. My grandma, his sister, almost refused.. we talked her into it. Two of my uncles said they weren't gonna get tested because they didn't want the risk of not being able to get further life insurance.. idiots.. but while we waited for grandmas test results, anyone in her descendants who may have anything that could cause cardiac distress needed a heart work up.. I was 7 months pregnant, and had a known heart murmur at birth, so off I go for major testing as well as my first cousins son who was going for knee reconstruction surgery. He was 7.. (had brittle bone disease. Unrelated ) both him and I came back good and luckily grandmas tests were negative. But another of her brothers refused to test (asshole) so his adult kids all had to go get tested themselves, again luckily all negative.. we have to assume B's grandpa was thr genetic carrier and his siblings just lucked out not having it.. but the stress we all went through waiting was awful. And the end results weren't even going to be fatal, so I can't imagine how awful this is for you

They could have told you many years ago so you could have some preventative treatments to delay the onset. You could have tested the embryo to make sure your future child doesn’t have it.

I think you are well within your rights to be incredibly upset with your parents and go low contact or even no contact with them. By not telling you about this genetic condition that can severely debilitate and even kill you, they have taken away so many of your life's choices. If you had had this knowledge previously, you would have had the ability to get tested to determine if you do have this disease and then plan your life accordingly. Now, they have not only affected your life but the life of your son as well. It is one thing to have children when you know you have a hereditary illness, but it is a whole other ballgame when you 1. Don't even tell that child they have and illness and 2. Let them pass that illness on to someone else. It is almost unconscionable to do that to someone under the guise of protecting them... Your parents made poor decisions all around, and there is literally no way to excuse their actions, no matter how they try to rationalize them.

I also think you should tell your siblings. I don't believe you mentioned their ages, so this, of course, would be age -dependent. But I would give them the opportunity that you didn't have. I would also get your son tested as soon as possible to see if there is anything that you can do to start mitigating disease progression early in case he does have the disease.

I want to include a story here to explain why things like this are important. My brother was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer right before he turned 35. He had a colonsscopy December 1st and the gastroenterologist came out and basically told me, "I am 99% sure this is colon cancer. He needs to get scheduled for surgery now." My brother and I saw the surgeon around December 18th, and we had genetic testing done that day to see if there was any genetic component because he was so young. Plus, our mom died of uterine cancer (died within a little over 2 months of diagnosis), and our paternal grandfather died of stomach cancer. When we got home, I told my dad that if something did come back, he would need to get tested, and he asked me why. My response was, "Well, Mom's not here to be tested, so testing you would be the only way to find out which side of the family has the genetic issue. On both sides of the family, you have had nieces and nephews lose their mother's to cancer (there was only one aunt with kids on each side, but the husbands were the ones related to my parents), so wouldn't you want to make sure that they knew ahead of time that there was a possibility they could have cancer in the future?" He understood after that. My brother had surgery at the beginning of January (he had it early because he gave himself a bowel blockage because he thought it would be a good idea to eat corn casserole and hot dogs... you already are having trouble digesting food, and that's what you go with?), and they diagnosed him with Stage 4 colon cancer after surgery. He has successfully been through chemo, and his scans have been clear. Last year's colonscopy was good, and this year's is coming up, so we're hoping things keep going smoothly.

I added that story to stress that genetic testing is important and talking about these things is super important. Yes, we might have to explain the importance to our parents, but I would rather do that than have them keep information from me. Information is power, and your parents are selfish. You better shout that info from the rooftops and let everyone know.

Regarding yourself and testing and knowledge And the choice to have biological kids are not. The volume of betrayal involved, and what they've chosen is massive. I'm so very sorry. And you are correct. This is not your secret. This is not your malicious avoidance. This is theirs. It's not your job to be deceptive and manipulative with your siblings. This is not your circus. And yes, what their ignorance shows is that there's all kinds of testing, but there's also the fact that any genetic predisposition we have, any condition or disease, we end up with, and will often times be improved, at least to a certain extent by our self-care. By taking good care in terms of sleep, and not overextending and not overstressing by Whatever mind-body measures sit for us. Stress reduction. Not your pathic resources to nourish all organs and systems in the Huntington literate manner that reflects what fits for that propensity. I am so sorry you have had this horrible betrayal.

NTA but be prepared for your siblings to possibly not listen. 

A decade ago a gastroenterologist found pre-cancerous cells in my colon and told me that all of my siblings needed testing too, because it was genetic and we are all high risk. My siblings all empathized with me and said they were glad I'd gotten the colonoscopy, but none of them got tested. Ever. It was like they put in ear plugs and refused to hear that they need to worry about themselves because it involved their buttholes.

One of my siblings just found out they have cancer. I'm sad and helping as much as I can, but part of me is angry that I've been very vocal over the years about the necessity of them getting tested and they either didn't believe me or thought they were magically immune.

Something similar happened in my family. My grandfather had a 'mysterious illness' that 'put him in a wheelchair' and they 'never found the cause'. All of this information came from his wife. I refuse to call her my grandmother. She was a horrible person.

Then one day, someone showed up at my parents' place. Turns out, he was a half brother from Grandpa's previous marriage. Apparently no one knew he was married before? The half sibling has the exact same 'mysterious illness' that grandpa had. A rare genetic disease, that also may or may not have been passed down to the other kids. Not huntingtons, btw.

Grandpa had passed many, many years prior to any of us kids being born. His wife hid it because she wanted grandkids one day, and just KNEW if her kids or their spouses knew of the disease, no one would give her grandkids. So she hid it, and took the choice away.

Plot twist, none grandkids out of 12 actually had anything to do with her. She played many stupid games, and won all the stupid prizes.

NTA but as someone who's known since early childhood I have a hereditary condition, i can tell you it's not a straightforward as you think. I have a hereditary eye sight condition but I was already born before the family were aware of it. My paternal grandad went blind suddenly when I was about 5 and that's when it was discovered. Everyone had to be tested. Only me and my uncle (dad's brother) have the condition. The blood vessels in the eyes weaken over time then suddenly just pop, and that's it. I've spent my whole life waiting to go blind. I wake up in the night sometimes in the dark room and panic that I'm blind. My uncle went blind about 4 years ago suddenly while driving, he was terrified and now I'm more worried it's getting closer. Trust me if you'd have known, you wouldn't be calm preparing. You'd have worried about it and it would have ruined your enjoyment of life knowing what's coming. Your parents are right there. 

Where your parents are AH is they shouldn't have had kids knowing the risk. Unlike my parents who didn't know, yours did. They are even more AH because they should DEFINITELY have told you when they knew you were going to have kids. Please tell your siblings and cousins from your Auntie (if she had kids) ASAP.

Your parents didn't just steal the ability to make informed health decisions from you, also the ability to make health decisions about your child. They valued their own denial over the health of your child. They valued defending their own parenting choices over your right to make your own. You can never trust them again because there are so many things they can value over the health and wellbeing of your child, not even related to this genetic disorder.

I am so sorry. I have an in-law with Huntington’s who has a similar experience, though fortunately they found out before kids. Such a heartbreaking scenario. Tell your siblings. Let them make informed decisions. They may choose to get tested or not, but at least they have that choice. Knowing also helps with diagnosis once symptoms start showing. There is a lot of research happening. I would suggest getting connected with your local or national Huntington’s research group who may be aware of studies and drug trials.

Please take care of yourself and your family. Going low contact is completely understandable.

NTA. Huntingtons is a terrible disease. I used to work with Huntingtons patients, and it was so hard watching them deteriorate and their children who had already tested positive for the disease know that what they're seeing their parent go through is their future. Please tell your siblings to get tested so that if they don't already have kids and want them, they can plan for that (IVF, adoption, sperm/egg donor, etc.). Your parents are horrible for not telling you but even worse for lying to you about it. It's also a good idea to have your son tested so when he gets older he's aware of his family medical history.

My first husband had Beckers Muscular Dystrophy, something his mom knew she had a 50/50 chance of passing down to any sons she had. He never really forgave her or made peace with the illness. It killed him, very young too. I encourage you to go into therapy now, not to forgive them, but to make as much peace with this as you can. My ex drank a lot to stave off his emotions and it didn't help... i guess i am just hoping to encourage someone else not to shoulder a burden like this alone or let the anger eat you up.

Also do tell your siblings. Do it in person and as kindly as possible. I would lead with, "I am letting you all know I was just diagnosed with Huntington's." Let them ask questions from there. They will ask what they can handle and just keep that you are dropping a nuke in mind. They can have genetic testing done so they aren't helpless in finding out. I would also consider having some literature/medical referrals on hand. Like, see if your 6 recommends a geneticist to see your siblings. Leave the anger and just try to meet them where they are, because they may have all kinds of emotions.

Also your anger is justified... but you are also in a grieving process and lets acknowledge you are going to go through a pleothora of emotions.

[–]Existing_Winter5679 5 points 4 hours ago 

I'm so damn sorry. Obviously you're NTA.

I had two friends who were sisters who had it, it ran through their father's side of the family and they always knew about it. Ironically, I found out in my early 20's that my own mother had it, but we don't know where it came from. I was lucky that I never wanted children, and that solidified my choice not to have them. I'm 44 now and have never been tested because honestly, I don't want to know until I have to or there's a cure.

For your parents to keep this from you, and outright lie about your aunt, is unforgivable to me. Fuck their feelings and intentions. Make them NC and please inform your siblings. They have the right to know and to make decisions based on this.

I'm so sorry. For what it's worth, look up intermittent fasting and Huntington's, it may help delay or lessen some of the symptoms

That is just so unnecessary to hide. Let your kids be able to look out for it. I'm sorry they never told you and now it's effecting your life. The way they handled that and continue to is wrong.

[–]Tired_Mama3018 4 points 8 hours ago 

I have several hereditary illnesses that unfortunately I didn’t get diagnosed with until several years after I had kids. Unfortunately my kids got them to various degrees. The good thing is my diagnosis got my kids their diagnosis early, so they aren’t going to have to go through what I did trying to find out what’s wrong, and hopefully early treatment can slow the progression. They don’t want to have genetic kids of their own to pass it down to and I respect that. Your parents are doing their kids dirty, leaving you floundering instead of setting you up for the best possible outcome.

I feel guilty as hell for passing this on to my kids, but I would never set them up for failure because I want to put my head in the sand and pretend that my shitty genetics didn’t make their life harder. I can’t reverse what they’re going through, but I can do everything possible to make sure they are getting proper treatment. You’re NTA, and yes, tell your siblings because their parent’s selfishness shouldn’t come at their expense.

[–]Alert-Potato 5 points 7 hours ago 

You have to tell your siblings. I don't know what your journey to diagnosis looked like, but it's so common for the medical community to brush off serious symptoms and blame them on mental problems, delaying diagnosis. They need to be aware of what symptoms to watch for, so they can get a diagnosis quickly. Which is something you should have been given as well. The fact that they not only selfishly chose to have children, but lied to you until you had children is sick. Definitely tell your siblings soon, before any of them procreate, so they can make informed decisions. Do not leave out that your aunt and grandmother both died of this disease, because your parents may try to spin this as a random genetic mutation that doesn't put your siblings at risk.

You're absolutely NTA for having low, or even no contact with your parents. They didn't just hide this information from you. They did this to you. Knowingly. Intentionally. They proactively took steps to ensure your existence, knowing this could be your future. Frankly, I think if you took steps to excise them from your life and left a will that would notify them of your death only long after the funeral so they can't get information or closure, would not be a step too far.

NTA.

My husband and I just had our first kid and he was extremely medically complicated. We found out after several major health events that he has a genetic condition, and my husband has the condition too, but had no idea. He wasn’t as affected as our son is.

Any kids of ours have a 50/50 chance to inherit it. And when we found out we immediately knew we wouldn’t be having any more kids, and we will be telling our son because his kids would have a 50/50 chance of having it as well. And his condition while it’s genetic so it’s not curable, it’s not terminal either like your disease is. But we still made the decision immediately to not have any more kids. What your parents did is the deepest level of denial and it hurt you, it potentially hurt your kid, and it’s going to hurt your siblings and their potential kids too. Tell them for sure:

[–]canbritam 3 points 6 hours ago

Message your siblings. Or rather, do a group video call. This isn’t information I’d want alone, or in a text. Tell them together. They deserve that information. Even if they don’t have it, what were they going to tell them as you got sicker?

Also, have your son tested now. It will either confirm it so that you know what you’re dealing with, show as a carrier, or show he doesn’t have either. It will, hopefully, bring you some peace when there’s really nothing peaceful about this. Your parents have done all of you an extreme disservice. I would also get yourself into counselling. You need to process all of this and it’s easier to do with someone who knows what they’re doing.

My parents have don't talk about anything other than surface-level stuff. Always. Everything, always swept under the rug. And I thought that was normal. Growing up, the only thing I knew that made me different from others was that I had ADHD, and I functioned well enough in school that I could go unmedicated. No big whoop.

And then in my early 20's, I started getting sick. I functioned throughout more or less for a few years, but I got sicker and sicker until I had to take leave. And as certain things got revealed throughout my own treatment, my parents have casually dropped bomb after bomb after bomb about their own health, as well as our family history. Getting information from them is like pulling teeth. Every time I learn something new, I get angrier and angrier and angrier, because they withhold information from not just me but my brother, too. I'm 32 now, and they STILL drop bombs whenever some new complication arises.

Your parents don't have a clue what they did to you. My parents don't have a clue what they did to me. I'm biased af, but you are completely justified to be pissed. Your parents had and still have, I believe, a responsibility to your physical and mental health, and their "protecting" you from the truth did the exact opposite. Tell your siblings everything.

In my family and in my fiancé's family there are a lot of potentially hereditary illnesses and we chose not to have kids. If we ever want to have kids we will adopt them (they could still be sick someday unfortunately but not because of us).

My parents did not know that there was a tendancy to auto-immunity in our family, they did not know I would have no less than three auto-immune diseases. But I DO know. I could not live knowing my kids may be sick because of me.

Your parents not only took the risk, but they lied to you which puts you at risk as well as your kid.

After reading a couple of paragraphs I was like: if this happened to me, I don't know if I would still have a family except of my husband and kid. And then I stumbled upon the fragment: "now they are begging me not to tell my siblings..." What the fuck was that even supposed to mean!? Your parents are a pair of galactic cuntosauruses. They don't give a damn about your wellbeing not that of your siblings not to mention their grandkids. Tell your siblings asap. They have every right under the sun to know this.

I'm sorry that they lied to you. What a horrible and shitty thing to do. My SIL passed away from it as well as her Dad. Her sister has it as well. I have nephews who refuse to get tested, and they have children.

I would most definitely go LC with my parents if they hid something like this. I'd also tell my siblings so they can make an informed decision on any future pregnancies.

NTA. People like your parents really disgust me. Since I've known about this disease and since I've been old enough to think about the general ethics of having children, I've always realised that people who bring children into the world with Huntington's disease, for example, are the very worst. The disease used to be called "Veitstanz" in Germany. And it is always fatal. It's not a nice way to die either. It's brutal.

I'm so sorry about your diagnosis. Please let your siblings know. Wouldn't just go LC but NC. And in a just world, there would be criminal proceedings for people who knowingly burden their children with this hereditary disease.

Huntington is no joke. You closed ones will also live I. Hell, because you will likely get a violent form of dementia in your later days.

My grandpa died of it. None of my fathers family has it. No uncle, no cousins, no one.

Me thinks grandpa is not my grandpa. (It was a known fact that my grandmother hated him), because this shit is very highly genetic.

My husband’s dad discovered he had a genetic disease when my husband was born because my husband had a worse version that almost killed him as a baby. Knowing this, we pursued IVF. Even though it’s been incredibly expensive and painful, as ny husband puts it, we’re spending $60k+ to remove his gene from the population forever — what a great investment!

NTA. So sorry your parents didn’t tell you and took away your chance to make the right choice for yourself.

You need to tell your siblings before any of them have kids. It's up to each of you to decide for yourself if you want to get tested so that you will know if you have it. Maybe you all do. Maybe none of you do. Maybe some will and some won't. I personally believe every one of your siblings needs to be informed, because having this disease could change their decisions with regard to education and travel and careers, as well as having their own kids.

I'm very sorry you are in this awful dilemma.

TELL. It's not their "secret" to keep. Get the kid tested.

Google says "A genetic counselor will discuss the process and results, and can help people make informed decisions. The cost of the test can range from $275 to $3640, and the emotional burden of the results can be challenging."

If the kid is off the hook, then that's one less thing to worry about. If not, you'll have planning to do.

[–]atashivanpaia 3 points 7 hours ago* 

hey, I also have Huntington's. unfortunately so does your son due to it being an autosomal dominant disease, the question is just whether it will present or not. So the more kids you have, the more likely it is that one of them will die from the disease, however all your kids will carry the trait for it.

as it stands, your best bet is to be on hyper alert for symptoms as soon as you turn 40, including relatively innocuous ones such as absentmindedness and brain fog. My dad is 46 and has been steadily declining for the past couple years. Normally early onset isn't as dramatic as his, however he also has frontal lobe damage from a car accident as a small child that has severely exacerbated it. Which is to say, please make your kid wear seatbelts, helmets, etc, the brain damage + Huntington's combination is no joke, my father is a shadow of his former self.

unfortunately there's nothing I can really recommend about dealing with the condition as a bystander (watching the people you love decline.) My grandmother passed away when I was 14, but had been functionally dead for years before then. It was extremely traumatizing to witness (especially because of our incredibly close relationship.) So if someone else in your family starts getting worse, don't make your son see them unless he feels he can handle it emotionally. I wish I hadn't seen my grandmother like that. best of luck to you op, I'm with you emotionally

edit about inheritance: I misremembered slightly, Huntington's is 50/50. my family has a particular variation on the disease that works as described instead (Myotonic Leukodystrophy, exact same effects , caused by different mutation)

Your parents were selfish for not telling you about your hereditary illness and risking your child's health. They made a conscious decision to have children, knowing the potential risks, and it's not fair to keep that information from you. You have every right to be angry and to share the truth with your siblings. They deserve to know the potential risks and make an informed decision for themselves. Your parents should have been honest from the beginning, and their actions show their true selfish motives. Stay strong and put your family's health first.

A (symptomatic with huningstons) friend of mine's brother has started refusing to invite her to any family get togethers, keeping his children away from her, because he refuses to let his kids (who are at the age where they're considering starting families) know that huningston runs in the family. Friend's father died from it, the brother apparently just lied to his kids about why their granddad died. The brother also refuses to get tested, says the same thing that he doesn't want to live in fear.

NTA — No idea about the specific illness but with each passing year we learn more and more about environmental factors, even in genetic disorders. There's something similar in my family and, even if we have the genetic marker, there are absolutely lifestyle choices that we can make to lower our chances of the actual disorder manifesting.

It's entirely possible that your case is different and there's nothing that could have been done, but I have a feeling your parents haven't been keeping up with the bleeding edge of science and probably have no idea if anything new has been learned about it.

Like I say not without assistance. We could have got rid of this disease by now without morons like this. It's easy to stop it, don't have kids.

How abhorrent that your parents want you to be complicit/participate in their unethical withholding of medical information. It's unbelievably fucked up to keep critical genetic information like this from someone. People make reproductive choices based on the risk of passing on diseases to their kids all the time and they robbed you of that choice.

You're right, they were never trying to protect you. They were trying to protect their comfort. Not having your siblings tested doesn't diminish the risk of them having the condition. Your parents need to pull their heads out of their asses.

When I went to the neurologist my docs were ready to talk to me about genetic counseling and family planning. I've never wanted kids, but I was so grateful that they made an effort (later. Initially I was mad they assumed I wanted them because I have a uterus). Wishing negative tests on your kiddo and siblings. It's a hard thing to know and think about. Like a little grenade in your skull on a timer. If you can, look into grief counseling or regular therapy, and make sure you have a will, trust, power of attorney, and all your 401k/financials have beneficiaries listed. It will hurt and be terrifying, but you'll feel better knowing things are handled for your kiddo when you lose some functions. I know it's hard, but disability and death come for us all.

I'm so very, very sorry you're dealing with this. My husband's family has Huntington's. It has taken many relatives. It's a horrible disease. From what I hear from my husband, many of his family members can't bring themselves to know if they have the disease since it is essentially a death sentence once symptoms develop. If you have it, that means your dad has is, as it does not skip a generation. As you are probably already aware, a child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease if a parent has it. I think the most vicious part of this disease is that it manifests at any age. You can become symptomatic at 15 or 85. I think that component really factors into people who are at risk for Huntington's being very hopeful and just living their life. This disease is just a sad and horrible, unfair thing. I very much wish you peace and comfort - for you and your whole family.

First and foremost OP, NTA. Not even close.

Secondly, I’m so sorry your parents lied to you, and I think you’d be doing a disservice to your siblings if you continued to lie to them.

Thirdly, I had a high school teacher, he was a bit of a hard ass first impression wise. He was actually a really kind and sweet man. When I was finishing high school, my BF at the time and a few of our friends were asked by him if we would be willing to help dismantle his old deck and build a new one because his wife needed better access. Turns out she had Huntingtons disease. At this point she needed assisted devices for mobility and she was non verbal at this point.

He told us about how they chose to get tested after she was diagnosed to see how likely it would be to pass down to kids, and she was at super high risk so they decided to not have children because of that.

This was over 20 years ago, I don’t believe she’s around any longer and reading your story reminded me of him, his kindness and how I am sure he must miss her every day.

I sincerely hope your son might be very lucky to not ever have it, but light your parents lie to the ground.

AITA for calling my parents selfish for having me, knowing they’d pass down a hereditary illness, and going LC after they hid it, putting my child at risk too? (self.AITAH)

submitted 9 hours ago * by Quirky_Background838

Edit: most of you figured it out anyway. It is Huntingtons.

I (28F) recently found out I have a serious hereditary illness that’s going to screw up my life, and I am so mad I can barely type this out. It’s a degenerative illness, no cure, nothing. My body’s just gonna slowly get worse. And the kicker? My parents have known this could happen my whole life and never said a damn word.

This illness runs in my family. My dad’s mom had it. His sister—my aunt—died from it a few years ago. I was living overseas when she passed, and my parents told me it was cancer. Cancer. They lied right to my face. It wasn’t until I got diagnosed that they finally came clean and admitted she had the same illness I do. When I confronted them, my dad wouldn’t even give me a straight answer. I asked if he had it too, and he dodged every single question, acting like I was overreacting.

My mom, on the other hand, tried to justify it by saying they didn’t want me “living in fear.” Are you kidding me? I could have been prepared! Instead, they chose to let me walk into this blind. And here’s where it gets worse—I have a 2-year-old son. My child might have this, and they never told me I was at risk. I could’ve had him tested, made informed decisions, anything. But no, they took that from me, and now I live in constant fear for him too.

Then my mom had the nerve to ask me if I would have rather not been born than deal with this. Can you believe that? She turned it around on me, like I’m the monster for even thinking it. And you know what? Yes, I said it. Yes, I would rather not have been born than deal with this disease. They made a selfish choice, and now I’m paying for it. They knew the risks and did it anyway, for themselves. They wanted kids, and now I’m stuck with this. I called them selfish, and I meant every word.

Now, they’re begging me not to tell my younger siblings. They don’t know about this yet, haven’t been tested, and my parents want to keep it that way. They’re hoping they’ll get lucky, but I’m not going to lie to them. I refuse to let them be blindsided like I was. They deserve to know the truth.

I’ve gone low contact with my parents. I can’t stand to even think about them right now. My mom keeps trying to guilt-trip me, saying they were “just trying to protect me.” Protect me from what? The truth? No, they weren’t protecting me. They were protecting themselves, from the guilt of knowing they passed this on, and now they want me to protect them too. But I won’t. I love my son and my siblings too much to lie to them.

AITA for going LC and refusing to keep their secret, even though they claim they were just trying to “protect” me?

So I have a 50% chance of Huntingtons. In the face of scary things people will often hide or just repress things.

I didn’t find out about Huntingtons till I was 32.  Everyone just stuffed it into Pandora’s box.

Knowing you could have a condition hanging over you can be very mentally draining.

Just my thoughts

[–]Strange-Elk1048 22 points 8 hours ago 

You’re very right. I have several family members that had Huntington’s. My grandmother lived in fear of developing the disease for much of my childhood (her mother and several older siblings had it). It was when she turned 60, her doctor was finally able to calm some of her fears. However, when testing became available in the 1980’s, she talked both of her daughters into getting tested so they could be positive it was not passed to them (irrational fear since Gram didn’t inherit it but understandable given her own fear for years). It’s a truly horrible disease.

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]Deedumsbun 6 points 8 hours ago 

I’m in the uk. I have looked into getting tested but you have to have genetic counceling before you can be tested.  Also you would have to disclose to any sort of insurance that you have it so holiday insurance would prob rise. Car insurance as well. Something that won’t prob affect me till I’m over 60. Only came to light because my mum has been acting weird. Suddenly afraid of having curtains open, answering door etc. No one else in my family have been tested. Having it hanging over your head when there is no cure is stressful. I have shoved it deep into a box. If I was having a kid I’d consider getting tested but I’m in the no kids camp. 

I could have it, I could not but what do I do when it turns out to be a yes I have it.  You can try and manage it when you have it and that’s it. I’m pretty sure knowing it’s positive would probably drive me to suicide.

Your parents are monsters. Ask them if they had HIV in the 90s would they have also spread that around purposefully? It’s the same shit. They purposefully spread a genetic disease with no remorse, and worse, they spread it to their own children.

Selfish is right. You aren’t the AH and I don’t think I would be able to talk to my parents anymore if they did this. A complete lack of empathy or love, it’s like they’re sociopathic.

Oh my - this is a horrible situation to be in. I have a brother with schizophrenia so my child has a 15% chance of becoming mentally ill. My husband and I had very long, hard conversations about having children before we decided to become pregnant.

Your parents decided to have you, and there is nothing you could have done to change that. But now they have taken away your right to choose whether to have a child who could potentially have this disease.

Also, you may have chosen to live a completely different life if you knew. I think they have been incredibly selfish, and I think your siblings have a right to get tested and to know. It will directly impact their life choices.

I think you're an asshole for calling them selfish for having. I don't think you're an asshole for calling them out on their li so and selfishness. 

The reason I think it's wrong to call them selfish is because that line of thought leads to eugenics. You start with "I would rather not exist than live with Huntington's", which becomes "People with Huntington's shouldn't be allowed d to procreate" which effectively means "people with Huntington's shouldn't exist". Basically, when applied more broadly, and not just to you specifically, what you're (hopefully) unintentionally saying is that the lives of everyone with Huntington's are not worth living, which is rhetoric that has been used to murder and sterilize groups targeted by eugenicists. 

They're still the assholes for not telling you. Keeping it a secret might have made sense when you were a kid, but they should have told you by the time you were 16, at the latest, since that's when most people start really trying to plan their lives as they think about what they want to do after high school and what classes they need to take to get there. 

I don't know how much younger your siblings are, but they deserve to know at some point. Or at the bare minimum have a hypothetical thrown their way. I dunno if there's any "would you rather know you have an incurable disease and plan for that or not know and live life without that stress but not be able to prepare" questions out there though. So, if you are going to tell them, and someone should, it doesn't necessarily have to be all at once. You could start smaller conversations about things related to Huntington's to slowly prepare them and you before you tell them the whole truth. Whether a fast or slow approach is the right one depends on you and your knowledge of your siblings though.

Hi OP

I am so sorry to hear your news. 

This a throwaway cause I both have that and have 2 kid and 1 is almost 18  .. 

My experience of finding out, test and almost no support, kinda destroyed me for 20 years.  Racked with fear, humiliation and guilt.  Times it way more my having a kids

For everyone picking sides here. Everyone is in pain hurting and tortured about the hobsons choice.   Ruin your early 20s or ruin your late 20s. 

Your folks too are probably terrified (I am of this horrible illness) and like everyone winging it

Of course your not an asshole and neither are your folks.  Everyone dealing with this is doing it for the first time and it will always be f&&ked up.  

For me getting over the hump was dealing with my anger and realising all my myriad was of chickening out of dealing with anything were in fact successful coping mechanisms 

I'm 52 now, no idea how, symptom free. 

DM me if you want or call a HD support group

All my love .

If I may ask what is the disease? Why are your parents still lying? Why not tell everyone? It’s not their fault but they should be honest. They probably did not know if they passed the gene unless they had genetics testing. They would have to know if they were carriers.

The most genetics testing can do is tell you if you are at risk to develop the disease. It cannot tell you definitely whether or not you will.

NTA - completely understand why you’re upset. Being angry at your parents won’t help you or your siblings though. Tell your siblings, talk to your son’s pediatrician & talk to your obstetrician about family planning.

I thought Huntington’s as well initially; however, it doesn’t say that one of her parents has it (based on OPs age, the parents should be in their late 40s at a minimum so one of them should be showing some signs by now). Also, 28 is young (although not impossible) to show symptoms so why would OP been tested for it if she knew nothing about it running in the family. Not saying you’re wrong, just very curious myself.

There are many hereditary degenerative diseases. None are great. If it is Huntington’s, grandma & aunt probably developed symptoms later in life, OP’s parents may not have known about the disease prior to OP being born.

I’m questioning how no one in the family knew why grandma & aunt passed. OP was overseas when aunt passed but where were siblings? Did no one talk about aunt’s illness? Seems strange.

Maybe they should have told you, but they were not selfish for having children. My mom's side of the family has a very high risk of gastrointestinal cancers which has killed half the people on that side of the family, should she not have had kids and risk them getting it? One of my greatest fears is to develop cancer and die slowly and painfully like she did, but I will never blame her one single day for having me. Everything in life is a risk, sometimes pure chance fucks you over, at least you had a chance to do something.

Once you get all of that figured out it will make it a bit easier, a bit. Find a support group, get your finances in order. I'm so sorry your parents chose to do this, but what's done is done.

ESH. Your parents suck for not only hiding it (although I kind of understand their reasoning, no need for you to get bent out of shape before finding out if you have it), but lying to you about how a relative died is bs, as is asking you to hide it, but, unless your siblings are over 18, that decision is kind of up to them.

You suck because, yes, you were an a-hole toward your parents with your reaction. Wanting kids doesn't make your parents selfish, it makes them fairly normal. There was a roughly 50/50 chance of passing it on, and they took the chance.

All that said, get your kid tested and let him know that he has the potential to pass it on regardless of the test result.

My mother and her family have the BRCA1 gene. They had me before it was recognized and tested for. Mom was tested before I had my daughter. You better believe I anonymously tested before I had my daughter.

Yes, I did test as anonymously as I could. I do not trust any health care system to NOT eventually go after HC for previously known conditions.

And not for nothing, but I married my USAF husband. They would preclude assignments based on the health of a family member. I could totally see them denying us an overseas assignment because I had the possibility of getting cancer.

As an overprotective helicopter mom, I can’t imagine throwing the phrase “ we wanted to protect you” around like nothing. Protection also comes into regard with health.

They wanted a family — but did they research preventative measures so that the illness doesn’t come as bad or as quickly? Did they put you on diets or have you exercise? Did they talk you through potential outcomes?

What did they do to contribute to try and prevent the strength of the illness? Let alone, did they do any

More than 1% of every child born in America will end up in prison. By your metric nobody should ever have children in America. Passing on genes is a crapshoot, life is a crapshoot, in ops case her parents odds were too fucked for it to be an ok thing to do, but every time someone has a kid it's a massive risk that that kids life will go badly. You gonna go and tell every person living in poverty they shouldn't be allowed to have kids? Tell genetically handicapped people they shouldn't? You gonna tell everyone living in a harsh part of the world they shouldn't be allowed to?

Your parents were incredibly selfish and irresponsible for not disclosing this crucial information to you. They robbed you of your right to make informed decisions about your own health and potentially your child's. You have every right to be angry and to distance yourself from them.

You are not the issue and I would be absolutely furious. Where you go next would depend on one factor, for me. Do you believe your parents reasoning? If they acted out of pure love and made a horrible, selfish decision, I think I could forgive, in time. But I would need them to properly acknowledge and understand that what they did was very, very wrong.

If you feel they are just making excuses and guilt tripping you, and deep down that they still feel justified, then it’s a hard no from me.

Good luck, OP, I really really hope your child has had the good fortune to miss out on that particular gene.

I have had this opinion for years and every time I mention it, bring it up and try and explain it I am met with vitriol, anger, and disbelief.

There is no reason to have a child that isn't selfish. Period.

I'm sorry parents but don't lie to me and say, "I wanted to continue to the human species!!" No, you didn't. You wanted children—a tiny piece of immortality. To share your thoughts, wants, and dreams with the future by producing a new generation. You did it FOR YOU. Always. Be mad at me all you like but it changes nothing. Your children exist, solely, and completely, because of what you want. Every pain, every ache, every disease, every hurt they suffered was caused by your choices.

I'm not saying you're a bad person. Wanting kids, or at least sex, is so ingrained in us as living things on this planet that it is probably THE MOST important thing on Earth. You did what your body, mind, and soul told you to do. The problem, save for being a victim of rape, you chose to create a life for a selfish reason.

Just own it and move on. Realize that you now owe that life you created everything. They didn't ask for any of this. (I don't want to hear some religious nonsense about how souls wanted to be born or whatever. Given the proof we have, that's not true, or at least unprovable. So, I'm going with the reality that children were forced into this life without choice.)

Just be good people to your kids. Live for them, die for them, because you are solely responsible for their existence. If you don't think you're responsible for them you're dead wrong. You made a horrendously selfish choice to give life to something that will one day die. So, like it or not, you're just as responsible for their death as you are for their life. Just make goddamned certain that you give them the best life you possibly can, otherwise, your selfishness will carry you to the grave as a bastard.

You are in your right, your absolute right because what kind of shitty parent doesn't tell his children those things?

As far back as I can remember, my mom used to talk about how hypertension ran in the family. She has hypotension, but my great-grandmother (and we suspect my anti-doctor grandmother) had hypertension. Possibly my great-great-grandmother die by hypertension. There's a good chance (75-25) that I don't have it.

Your parents knew that you were lucky if you didn't have that disease, that's like an 89-11 max, but they never say a word. You should tell your siblings.

That’s a life sentence when you committed no crime. No one deserves that. Tell your siblings so they can make truly informed decisions regarding their own potential prognoses and life choices.

And, this is going to maybe sound odd, but document what’s happening right now. Leave records for your own child, telling them that you didn’t know what you were potentially passing onto them or their own children. Make diaries, videos, something with longevity so they know that you didn’t do this to them or their children on purpose. That, while you will never regret having them, that you would not have knowingly opened them up to this hurt and potential lifetime of illness and misery.

In the meantime, therapy. For all of you. There is actually a somewhat decent support system out there (not necessarily in person, but definitely online) for people who are genetically predisposed to, well, crappy genes like BRACA, Huntington’s etc. so when you’re ready, perhaps seek some help to process…

I have some distant experience with this too. (Very distant. Not saying I know what you’re going through, I was just an outsider looking in.) An employee had the Huntington’s gene and had 4 kids. He was adopted so had zero family history and two of his children passed before he did. It was awful watching from the sidelines. I cannot imagine how he felt as their parent and that he passed onto them their cause of death.

So yeah. Tell them. Don’t feel guilty. They deserve to know. NTA.

[–]StoresoesKanIkkeAlt 3 points 7 hours ago 

I know two people who has Huntingtons, and it must be awful.

One didn't get told before their siblings was 18+ and could get tested. But thankfully got told before having kids and I know they had to stop a pregnancy because the child had the genes, sadly.

Another one didn't grt told before after having children and that must be so cruel.

Having children is imo the most selfish thing you can do - but not telling them of such a disease, especially one they can pass on. That should honestly be illegal.

Wow. I have epilepsy and we did so many tests to make sure my daughter didn’t have anything wrong. Genetic test, blood tests, I was on different medicine just to make absolutely SURE my baby was born healthier than me.

My seizures are not genetic they were caused by trauma. I wanted a baby more than anything and was told I couldn’t have one when I was 19. There was no way I’d let my self have a baby thinking she might have the same horrible life I did.

And to make you feel better, I also told my parents “no fuck you! I was a save the relationship baby who you then abused. No I’m not glad I was born, yes I know I wouldn’t have married my husband or had my daughter but you know what?

I would seek the Lord for peace even though you may not want to hear that or even understand that and probably even upset about it .

I would encourage you to give it a serious consideration , now , I believe anyone should regardless , but often times it takes us desperate and disastrous situations before we ever will and that is the blessing in disguise should we follow through and experience the supernatural encounter with him that leads to truth and then comfort and peace .

Miracle healing is not promised but it also can happen and has for many , ultimately what matters is not this life for any of us even though we put so much emphasis on it , eternity that follows is what matters .

Anyways , I am sorry to hear of all this and I hope you will find some peace and strength right now

There's a high chance your son won't have it because diseases always tend to hop-skip a generation meaning it won't be your son specifically but he'll be a carrier and it's your grandchild that will suffer the same affliction that's just how it works.

I got psoriasis from my mother's side even though she and my father and my father's side of the family didn't suffer from it. So I highly believe my maternal grandfather or grandmother had it. It may not be as bad as cancer but i've lived with it going on thirteen years and I wouldn't wish this on my children or grandchildren.

So I don't blame you, I've asked myself that same question and felt the same way you're feeling you're NTA for feeling the way you do.

I am so sorry you are going through this. It must be very scary for you knowing the consequences. Your parents did a wrong thing. They were indeed selfish. You have every right to be angry at them.

Not related to this but your situation made me reflect some of my own thoughts about my son's autism diagnosis. I always thought I will tell my boy about his diagnosis when he is ready. But after talking one of his therapists I started to have a different perspective. His therapist mentioned that she also has an autistic son who is well established in his career, family life. She never revealed his diagnosis to him. Her logic was that the diagnosis is for herself to know in what ways she could support him. But knowing about the diagnosis would only make her son question about his ability.

After hearing about her logic... I kind of started to debate whether it should be known to my boy about his diagnosis or not. My boy is still very young (he is 2) and I have plenty of time to evaluate my decision. But as a parent I want to do what is best for him. I can be wrong with my judgement but my intention is only to help my boy any way possible.

There is a chance that your parents also felt that way. They made a mistake. Their judgement was wrong. But as parents they thought they were protecting you. You don't have to forgive them if you don't want to. But having a grudge within yourself will only hurt you. So forgive them or not... let your grudge go and focus on yourself.

I wish you the best.

Please contact a Huntings support group near you. They will help you find neurologists and speech therapists who can help you prepare. Have genetic testing on yourself (if you aren’t yet aware that you have the disease). Have genetic testing done on your son so he can be aware of his status.

You actually are validating a debate I keep having with friends/family. Couples who are aware of a hereditary illness, which limits the quality of life of the person with the illness, should not have any kids. Some agree with me and some say I'm an AH for thinking like this. That everyone has the right to live.
Yes, everyone has the right to live and if someone is born with any type of illness or syndrome without the previous knowledge of the parents then yes, of course this person should live and should have the best quality of life they can have.

Thank you for giving us an inside of how a person with a hereditary illness might think about being born with it.

Your siblings, if they are over 18, should know about their potential future and should be tested. If the siblings are younger lets say pre-teens maybe wait when they are a bit older to understand better the illness and whatever comes with it. Older teens, under 18 should be informed as well but getting tested it's under your parents guidance unfortunately.

Definitely NTA here.

That is also a valid option if a couple can afford it. I believe though that in some countries having selective IVF is not permitted. Although many clinics by pass the law and just say "the embryo was not viable" or something.

Adoption is also an option. Although I'm not sure about this depending from the illness.

I inherited Bipolar Disorder from my dad's side. His grandmother, mother, and my older brother all have/had it. Osteoarthritis runs in my mom's family, and it starts fairly early. My grandmother has had multiple joint replacements because of it. My mom just got her knee replaced after years of living with zero cartilage in her knee. And she'll definitely need other joints replaced soon enough. I'm in my mid 20s, and I've already started showing signs of it in my knees and back.

I decided years ago that while I want kids, I will not risk passing these and other serious health issues to my future children. It wouldn't be right, and they would suffer like I do. So when I'm financially stable, I'm going to foster and adopt.

Honestly, you are 100% correct.

THAT is why I always say it is a thousand percent selfish for people with hereditary diseases to choose not to get tested and then have kids. If you don’t want to get tested, then don’t have a child! Stay child free and live in denial. But the second you decide to bring a baby into the world and not get tested then it’s a selfish choice. The baby deserves to know and your refusal isn’t about them but you.

I think I know which disease you mean as the men mostly are carriers and the women get affected more. Tell your siblings because they deserve to know and get your son tested

True. It was just heartbreaking for her to be defined by her community by her inability to have bio children. It wasn't a one-off. It was several times. Once it was known throughout the community, guys wouldn't even look at her twice.

Tbf, how much does the average person care about someone else before or on their first date? Unless it's a date with someone you've known a while, not so much. Those guys didn't do anything wrong, most people who want children want biological children. Some don't care. I'm glad she find a compatible partner! I hope her health has been good.

True, but it still hurt being viewed solely as the one who couldn't have kids and therefore not as valuable as women who could bear children.

Redditors are finicky in their beliefs. I was downvoted by saying someone doesn't have the right to cheat just because there are sexual issues going on in a relationship. People kept saying that the guy has every right to cheat. Two days letter, there's a post about a similar thing and everyone is getting upvoted by saying exactly what I said on that other post.

NTA.

I know a thing or two about Huntington’s and it’s indeed a selfish thing to pass on to your kids.

If you can use IVF to make sure you don’t pass it on, I’m more on the okay side. Although a kid will still see his parent deteriorating and suffering, the child will at least be spared.

But blindly jumping into having kids because you want them??? Noooo!

If you have the gene, your children have 1 chance of 2 of having it too. If you have the gene, you will get ill. There’s no such thing like a carrier of the gene that doesn’t get it.

Have your son tested right away. There’s a juvenile form of the disease with a much earlier onset. You’re going to want to be prepared in case your kid has the Westphal variant.

If I were you I’d call up my siblings one by one and tell them what’s going on. First of all they need to have the choice to get tested and second of all you don’t want them not knowingly passing this on to their children if they haven’t already. They have the right to know. I’m totally with you on this.

I really hope your son’s gonna be fine. I really do! And I’m sorry for you. I’d feel the same way, ya know. Knowingly passing on Huntington’s is a selfish thing to do. And then being kept in the dark about it… can’t imagine how betrayed you must feel. I hope for all the patients that one day doctors can find a cure. But I know it doesn’t exist yet.

They should honestly have told you, when you were old enough to know. That way, like you said, you could have been prepared and come to terms with your situation. Your partner also deserves to know, that this is your situation. I get that they were trying to protect you, but at some point they should definitely have told you. AT LEAST after you turned 20. That way you’d had a childhood and teenage years without worry.

They made the decision to have kids knowing the disease was hereditary. They should have told you so you could have made your own choices as well. Your siblings also deserves to know to know. Imagine finding out you have a serious hereditary illness and only finding out when it starts getting bad, only to know you could have mentally prepared yourself for it for decades and that people knew about it?!

Tell your siblings. They deserve to be informed. They can get tested, and find out whether they’ll get it or not. They can also have the choice to have kids based on that knowledge.

Your parents are killers. Point that out to them. They chose to have kids knowing they have something they can pass on that will kill their children and grandchildren. What else would you call it? Me? I say they had kids to let them die, to kill them.

But, it feels like this thread is jumping to a lot of unnecessary conclusions. OP says her parents were selfish for having kids, but it doesn’t say anywhere that the parents knew dad had the gene when they conceived. Maybe they knew, but it’s very possible that didn’t. It’s hard not to see it through the lens of today, but the 1990s was a different universe. Genetic testing was way less common 28+ years ago and the internet as we know it today was basically nonexistent back then, so it’s possible they didn’t really understand much about the disease or how it was transmitted at the time. It’s also possible that OP’s grandparents hid it and her parents did not know at the time of conception, then chose to continue the secrecy with their children. Part of me wonders because how in the world did a family member not spill, even if inadvertently?

Regardless of what/if they knew at conception, the parents are wrong for hiding it from their kids. There is no world where that is okay. This is something that 100% affects OP, not them, so they have no right to keep it secret. Once they knew, they had a duty to tell their kids at the earliest appropriate time. There’s no need to tell a 5 year old, but there is absolutely need to tell a teenager. Lying about the cause of death of family members is beyond reason and completely unhinged.

OP - it seems like this is very new news for you and I’m so sorry. Take all the time you need to grieve your diagnosis, then tell your siblings and any other family members you are close to. What they do with the information is on them, but at least they will no longer be flying blind. End this cycle of secrecy and deception, but steel yourself for the fall out. You’re not to blame just because you refuse to lie.

As far as your parents, you are absolutely justified in being furious with them. Their lying has forever altered your relationship with them and your view of them. You likely thought they were good intentioned people who wanted the best for you, but this new information rips that to shreds. Them doubling down and justifying their actions instead of apologizing says a lot about the kind of people they are. Low contact is probably the best thing to do for right now as you process. It is completely understandable and reasonable to take time away from someone who seriously hurt you. You don’t have to make a permanent decision about that relationship right now, or ever, if you don’t want to. Your focus needs to be on you and your little family managing through this as best you can, not on them. It’s easier said than done, but try not to let them suck away any of your energy. Energy is finite, especially when you’re unwell, and any energy they take is stealing from something else and they don’t deserve it.

Mate, I was a teen in the 90’s. I knew plenty of people who refused to have kids to not pass on something, even without gene testing being available. It was called giving a shit for what you might pass on. In fact, doctors would recommend they didn’t, as well, just in case.

When enough people in a family die of the same issue, most people would think “well, maybe I shouldn’t breed”.

[–]BiffyMcGillicutty1 4 points 5 hours ago 

I was a teen in the 90s. There was so much bad information out there and there wasn’t an easy, up to date way to fact check. We looked up information in encyclopedias that could be years old. Even if you cared, you could easily get it wrong.

These parents are shitty for hiding the family history and lying without also knowingly conceiving. I believe it is selfish to knowingly conceive a child if you know there’s a high probability that he/she will have a poor quality of life. All I’m saying is that the lying on its own is terrible enough, we don’t have to dig up history or jump to any conclusions.

It's the equivalent of knowingly and voluntarily giving aids to your children. The parents have essentially murdered their own progeny. Unfortunately the current law doesn't protect children from this. The "right to have children" should never outweigh the rights of those children to be born healthy and disease free. It needs rewritten.

This. Testing is for your siblings to decide, if they want to know now. But it should be their decision, based on rightful information.

Your parents are withholding that information. You aunts and uncles maybe too, since you don’t mention your cousins.

Message to your parents; you choose to let me spread a disease that could have stopped after me. As devastated I am by this diagnose myself, I want to make sure no new kids are born in this family without testing. I can’t stop my disease but I can do a lot to prevent kids from having it.

And give them the option; your parents tell it, or you will.

Take care of yourself. Focus on your own family after you informed everyone who should know.

You need to group message all your siblings and give them all the information you have and that they need to prepare for the possibility of having the disease.  You cannot possibly be there considering being the monumental AH that your parents are and letting them and their children suffer from something that they can prepare for. 

If they don't have children yet, they need to know about the illness and make informed choices.

The duty to warn genetically at-risk relatives of patients is one of the most misunderstood legal and ethical issues affecting clinical genetics. The legal doctrines are often associated with three state appellate court cases beginning in the mid-1990s. Since the HIPAA Privacy Rule went into effect in 2003, the duty to warn must be accomplished by warning the patient of the genetic nature of a diagnosed disorder or genetic risk and the necessity of warning at-risk relatives. 

 The parents have a legal obligation to inform and warn their children. 

They are wanting OP to be complicit in this cover up which in itself is illegal and her siblings are well within their rights to sue her too if she doesn't disclose this information

Even if it doesn't apply, she can sue her parents in a “wrongful birth’ claim:

she alleges that, had she been informed of her father's, grandmother's and aunt's diagnosis, she would have been tested and, if that had proved positive for the illness , would have terminated the pregnancy.

 She was a single mother, and would have wished to prevent the risk of her being dependent upon her child, or dying, leaving her child an orphan, and the risk that her child would inherit the condition.

Whether she would be successful in her lawsuit or not, is for the courts to decide.

It's more complicated.  Dad wouldn't know if he showed symptoms or got tested himself.  He actually can't pass it on without having it himself, Huntington's is a dominant gene. Because Huntington's is so fraught they even will do "blind" IVF on parents who may have it so that they don't actually disclose to the at risk parent if they have it or not, they just screen embryos for it (if the parent has it).

[–]maroongrad 56 points 8 hours ago 

HELL NO. Call your siblings NOW. There are treatments out there that slow it down, and there's a lot of promise with CRISPR and gene-editing. Finding out BEFORE they have symptoms is huge. It also lets them prepare if they ARE positive for it, and when symptoms show they are ready and know what to do and to expect. Your parents are awful, awful people. If you haven't, get your kiddo tested NOW and tell your family IMMEDIATELY. I would honestly not go LC, I'd go NC. Your dad is going to need round-the-clock care and you KNOW your parents HAVE NOT BEEN SAVING UP TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. Nope, they will expect their kids to take care of them with no warning.

Tell your family. Tell your spouse (I'm assuming you have, but if not, that's needed). Test your kid. And give every single person the link to this post.

Kicker? We've been able to test for Huntington's SINCE 1993. THEY COULD HAVE KNOWN BEFORE HAVING CHILDREN. Period. And starting in '96, preimplantation analysis, checking a fertilized embryo before doing IVF, was possible. IF THEY HAD TOLD YOU, YOU COULD 100% HAVE AVOIDED HAVING A CHILD WITH HUNTINGTON'S.

Yeah, I'd go NC with them at this point. They do not have anyone's best interest at heart besides their own. Know why they had so many kids, rather than just ONE if they just HAD to be parents? Because your dad already knew he had it. And they wanted at least one healthy kid to take care of him when it hit.

For people reading silently thinking "so what you were gonna abort your son if you knew?" - you can actually screen Huntington's out if you use IVF to conceive, so you stop it spreading to future generations and still have your kid this way.

From what i can read it can be screened for, but only if you want them to and if you know there is actually a risk of Huntingtons. The screening used is done at around the 10th week of the pregnancy but it also has a risk of around 1/100 to 1/500. I think this added risk is the reason that it isnt tested for in every pregnancy. If OP had been told they could have at least had the informed choice on wether to take this risk or not, making it all the more evil..

The baseline Ivf involves taking sperm taking eggs slamming them together and making embryos. Then implanting a bunch of embryos hoping that some stick.

My ex has Huntingtons and was only told at 18 that his dad had very sick with it, he just thought he'd abandoned him at 12, he then only 6 months later got genetic testing and has it and has so much resentment towards his mother and anger and it's meant that I genuinely don't think he can enjoy life. She also did it out of 'protection'

Not disclosing this kind of stuff early, means you set up a kid to think they're going to have a normal life when in reality they are definitely not, as they will probably have family members with it and also have whiplash if they find out they have it themselves. As it also affects your mental health as mood swings are one of the symptoms, it's also shit because you may have no idea why something is happening and get misdiagnosed.

[–]budgefrankly -3 points 7 hours ago*

I don't think it is necessarily true that they "prioritized their own comfort"

At what point do you tell a child that there's a 50/50 chance they have an illness as debilitating as Huntingtons. Would you tell them when they turned 18. Would you allow them to enjoy college life and tell them on graduation. Would you allow them to enjoy their early twenties and tell them at 25?...

I can understand the desire to let a young person live without such a burden for as long as possible, particularly when it wasn't certain if it would materialise.

At the same time, I think there was a need for brutal honestly once OP was an adult, either at 18, or after college graduation. I can see why they might have been afraid of the ripple effect on what sound like younger siblings.

So I have some empathy for the parents. I think, at least initially, there was some kindness in what they were doing, but their mistake was that they clung to to hope instead of forcing OP and themselves to confront a brutal reality. Ultimately I think they got trapped in the lie and hoped the worst-case scenario would never materialise.

All you can do now is look out for your son. Get him tested. My husband, son, and I went through extensive genetic testing (WES, WGS, CMA), and nothing was found, including secondary findings. I was absolutely shocked, given my family history. You may not have anything to worry about, but you won't know unless you seek out testing. My dad was adopted and very secretive about his birth parents. Genetic testing was a way for me to get that power back from him.

NTA. Cancer runs in my dad’s side of the family; my paternal grandmother died of it. I’m (33F) at high risk for that, and I’ve already battled two other types of cancers. My parents got a DNA analysis done six years ago to see my risk levels and stuff. Back when I was born, we had no idea such cancers are hereditary. My parents had no idea I’d end up getting cancer. They were quite upset and took great care of me. Knowing what I know now, I’ve chosen to be childfree.

You have every right to feel angry at your parents for withholding this important medical information from you and not letting you prepare yourself physically and mentally. NTA.

Honestly, for me, that depends on how old the siblings are. If they're young, they won't understand it anyway beyond that they might be sick. If they're old enough to understand what this means, definitely tell them.

I say this because I'm 22 years older than my youngest sibling. I had both my kids by 21. If I'd told my youngest sibling something like this when either of my kids were 2, she wouldn't have understood and it would have done no good for anyone.

Exactly, we lost my Dad to colon cancer, and my brother survived colon cancer (he had a colonoscopy after Dad passed and as a result it was caught early).

It's shocking how your parents chose to hide something so important from you. Keeping quiet about a hereditary illness not only blindsided you but also put your son's health at risk.

Your parents' decision to withhold crucial information about a hereditary illness not only shows a profound lack of responsibility but also a shocking level of selfishness. By keeping you in the dark about your family's medical history, they deprived you of the opportunity to prepare for the reality of the disease, leaving you to navigate a life-altering diagnosis without any foresight or support. Their attempt to justify their actions as "protective" is deeply misguided; they prioritized their own comfort over your right to make informed choices about your health and your child’s future. This betrayal has not only disrupted your life but also potentially jeopardized your son's well-being, showcasing a glaring disregard for the impact of their choices on your family.

If someone knows then they can be genetically tested and see if they have the specific genes or they can arrange to have regular tests to see if they are ok

Oh! I wish I could give you a hug right now.

My sister-in-laws best friend died from Huntington disease. She always knew it was a possibility. She tested positive and opted not to have children. Her sibling who has tested positive has made the same choice. They understood the risks and they made their choices.

Your parent’s decision to hide this from you is beyond selfish. You have a right to know. Your siblings do need to know. It’s only fair to them and any children they might choose to have. You all have the right to make informed decisions. Trying to turn it on you and make you feel bad for being angry just takes them further over the line.

NTA. My parents did the same to me knowing and Im terminally ill at 24 years old from not being able to or even having the knowledge to try to offset the effects of my conditions. It was selfish at all to breed, at least in my case, and not only that but my parents kept me and everyone else in the dark about it. It wasnt even that I wasnt seeking care/answers. Ive been very unwell and wonky all my life and started seeing doctors for it regularly by 7. By middle school I was very aware something was very wrong and doctors didnt know either so would bandaid slap it all. I needed surgeries and treatments I never got bc everyone denied there was a bigger issue.

My parents knew. EDS type 4, the vascular, and Charcot Marie Tooth disease. My dad told me about the CMT disease maybe 7 or 8 months ago. The EDS type 4 was only found bc they couldnt figure out why my organ failure was so rapid. And both parents knew. You are 100% NTA and your parents are selfish af OP. Im sorry. I also wouldve rather never been born. Ive been either hindered or in outright pain probably 97% of my life after 6 years old and told to suck it up by doctors while my parents implied I was a big faker knowing I was a genetic wonk.

[–]BidetBlasting 0 points 3 hours ago 

I'm not going to comment on EDS as that is serious and unexcusable.

However CMT is something I've known I've had my entire life. That one I would be aware of but I wouldn't worry too much about as there's not a lot you can do other than a few things (some of which I definitely have not followed), stay fit but don't push yourself too hard, get your feet checked out at the first sign of any discomfort. Avoid anything that isn't anesthesia that is a neuro toxin as that will fuck you up (common chemo drugs fit in this category).

That said I'm doing this under the assumption you have one of the more common and less severe sub types of CMT, if you're 2[letter], x, or one of the more severe types of 1 I'm sorry.

NGL though it's times like these I'm glad I am asexual while I just waxed poetic that it's not that bad, I consider it highly unethical to have kids with this disease. It kind of low-key ruined my childhood between pt, my dad insisting it's not real, some bullying because I was an easy target, and a foot surgery when I was 7 because my lineage gets really really bad foot problems without. This unethical fact is what drew me to this thread in the first place.

My family also has a history of that. Guess you, me and OP are distantly related somehow. It's a cruel disease made more cruel by the fact that getting it or not is basically a coin flip, and if you win the coin flip neither you nor any of your children or descendants will ever have it. In my mother's case, she is the only one of five in her generation to win the coin flip... and most of them didn't find out until my grandfather passed from it, meaning they already have their own kids. I don't know how many in my generation won or lost their coin flip, because my mother's luck ended up driving a wedge between us and that side of the family and I haven't even met most of them.

The good news is that the advancement of research into Alzheimer's is also showing promising results for Huntington's patients. Maybe the pursuit of one will yield results for the other.

I see what you're saying, but why are people so gung-ho on biological children

I know adoption isn't easy or that child could have any variety of issues too, but it's a perfectly viable option for people that want children. If you truly want children, non-bio would be fine

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]yellsy 1 point 6 hours ago 

I had to go to AI for how to articulate this one - it’s hard to explain why people want biological kids. As someone who has them now and suffered from some minor fertility issues, I had to go through it to understand why there’s pain involved. Adoption is a wonderful thing, but not for everyone. Older children have serious issues sometimes due to neglect etc, and adoptive parents have to be prepared for that. Adopting a healthy infant is insanely expensive and there’s a years long waitlist.

Per AI: “Telling someone with fertility issues to “just adopt” is hurtful because it minimizes the complex emotional experience of infertility, disregards the personal desire to carry and birth their own child, and implies that adoption is a simple solution to a deeply personal struggle, often overlooking the emotional and financial complexities involved in the adoption process.”

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]colieolieravioli 5 points 6 hours ago 

I totally realize it is not "simple" and there's no guarantees in any direction!

I truly don't understand because I am staunchly child free (sterilized) so I have less than zero desire for a biological child

It just seems so...odd. I truly feel like the whole of the adoption/childcare system could be vastly improved if more people cared about it i.e. people invested in THAT instead of IVF treatments.

Not to minimize fertility issues, but you could spend thousands of dollars and never get pregnant. That child could have horrible health problems. Child could have inherent behavioral problems. There's just no guarantee that biological is better and helping another living breathing child in need seems like it should fill that void of wanting to love and raise a child.

I understand that it doesn't, and I understand theres probably no answer that would satisfy me because it's really just a lot of feelings. At the same time it seems so steeped in hubris and not totally necessary, when there ARE other options

    permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply

[–]RishaBree 9 points 4 hours ago 

I've never looked into it, but I'm highly doubtful that anyone diagnosed with Huntington's would ever be approved for adoption under any circumstances. And a family history of it would likely be a fatal strike against it as well, unless whichever agency accepted a clean genetic test (and at that point, they'd be fine to have a bio child anyway).

People like to toss out adoption as a suggestion without realizing that a huge swath of the population would be ineligible if they tried, for a variety of reasons.

But then those children will be born to parents who will deteriorate and die young. Possibly before the children are grown up themselves.

Huntingtons is autosomal dominant so if you have the faulty gene you WILL get the disease. If you don’t have the faulty gene you can’t pass it on anyway so no need for IVF.

Your parents really failed by hiding that illness from you. Keeping that secret tossed you into chaos and put your son’s future at risk. Their desire to avoid guilt shows they didn’t think about how this affects you. Stepping back from them seems like the right call; they need to face the reality of their choices. You deserve clear answers, not their excuses.

So does that mean that dad definitely has it?

Slightly worse than most dominant diseases, Huntington's is also the archetypal example of a condition with genetic anticipation.

Basically, the genetic cause of Huntington's is a triplet repeat sequence - if you have more than a set number, you will get Huntington's. But the more repeats you have, the earlier the onset and the more severe the disease. Once you have over the threshold for disease, the repeat typically becomes unstable, and when making copies for new cells, more repeats can be added. This isn't an issue for the individual themselves (one cell out of many), but is a bigger issue for their sperm/egg cells, where that single high-repeat cell is the basis of all cells in their offspring. Thus, the children of someone with the Huntington's allele can be affected even before their parents.

This is likely to be what has happened here, with OP being affected before their father (since he is an obligate carrier and has to have the variant). Anticipation can be sex-biased, and in Huntington's big jumps are usually transmitted paternally, while maternal transmission of the variant typically presents with a similar age of onset/severity.

I would say that not all cases of Huntington's occur very early in life and while fatal it's typically around 20 years after symptom onset, meaning the most typical age of death from it is 50-70 years - it is definitely still an early death, but people affected can have families before they even know they're affected.

"typical age of death from it is 50-70 years"

Not in my experience -- I've seen this freight train in two (separate) families and I noped when reading above about some living a 'natural life span.'

In the UK, I believe IVF with screened embryos is free on the NHS (national public health service) for conditions like this. A friend of mine has a different congenital condition and just had a kid with free IVF screening.

Except she might not live long enough to raise her kid. I don’t think I could do that to my family.

My mum is 58, is still top fit and has no symptoms yet. Of course not everyone is as lucky, but you can’t generalise it.

This is what her parents wanted to avoid. She might pass up on so much life has to offer fearing that she won't survive.

I think this was OP’s parents’ real hope - they were trying to guarantee themselves grandchildren. That’s the only (incredibly shitty and selfish) reason I can think of to not tell your children about something like this. They didn’t want to scare them away from having their own children.

Imagine being the ops spouse. Now he/she has to deal with this and no offense to op or others but maybe he would of picked a different partner or also not want kids if they knew. If I was the spouse I would lose my shit and either lawsuit or get physical because the parents have no shame and even Playing victim it’s sickening.

Another selfish possibility is that maybe dad wanted to keep his own head in the sand. If he has chosen not to get tested himself and doesn't have symptoms, he might not have known for sure that he was a carrier until OP got diagnosed.

He could have been hiding it from his kids because he was afraid that if they got tested then he would find out or guess the results, and that might tell him something he didn't want to know about himself.

I was just thinking that this is literally my life. Known history of family illness, parents took the gamble anyway, decided to have FOUR children. I have three healthy siblings, and I am going to die. My siblings have already taken measures to make sure that they will not pass this down, it ends with our generation. None of us in good conscience can have children. Parents didn’t fess up until they had already doomed one infant with the more aggressive form. Monstrously selfish, I will never forgive them.
