Something like 95% of Africans have some kind of religious affiliation, and numbers have risen most strongly among the young. As they leave the continent with their faith in tow, African churches are springing up all over the place.

Gladiator 2 is out in the UK today and in the US next week. If all historical films say as much about our own age as the one they're depicting, what, asks our correspondent, do these muscly figures and superhuman strength slaves tell us about ourselves?

Though we're going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine, last night US President-elect Donald Trump underlined one of his key foreign policy promises: to end the war in Ukraine. "It's got to stop. Russia and Ukraine's got to stop. Thousands and thousands of people over the last 3 days were killed. Thousands and thousands of people were killed. They happened to be soldiers, but whether they're soldiers..."

His relationship both with Russia and Ukraine is complicated. He's consistently refused to condemn Vladimir Putin's invasion. He appears to admire the Russian dictator's strongman style, and he once tried to blackmail Ukraine by withholding military assistance. So you might think that Trump's election victory would be a crushing blow to Ukraine. And yet, after the election, everyone in Ukraine is, of course, a signed-up member of the MAGA crowd. I mean, I've even seen "Make Ukraine Great Again" caps doing the rounds.

Alliv Caroll is The Economist's Ukraine correspondent. But in truth, at least part of the political and military leadership were hoping for a Trump victory. I'm really surprised to hear you say that. In what way could Trump be good for Ukraine?

Indeed, there is nothing in Trump's history that makes him seem particularly pro-Ukrainian. He's also quite fond of Vladimir Putin and his strongman antics, and he never really condemned the invasion. So it tells you really a little bit about how sticky the relationship between Zelensky and the Biden administration had become in recent times. The Americans were, on their side, annoyed at the Ukrainian sort of boots-on-the-table cowboy-type diplomacy. The Ukrainians, on the other hand, were getting annoyed at what they saw as the rhetoric of support being "in it for as long as it takes" for a Ukrainian victory, but they saw actions that were saying otherwise. So in the end, they were kind of ready to exchange that drip-drip life support for a gamble. You could, you know, argue it either way. Ukraine obviously hopes that Trump will be strong and decisive, put an end to the dithering. Though everyone here understands the range of possibilities is much greater, from very bad to very good.

But wasn't Trump actually promising to end the war within 24 hours? I mean, there's a general understanding on both sides, Russia and Ukraine, if not perhaps in the Trump camp, maybe even there, that you can't end this war in 24 hours. There are too many complicated moments. I was chatting to one high-placed source who's regularly in the Kremlin, and he said quick peace is not going to happen. Maybe a ceasefire, but only if that was combined with a discussion of what he called a new security system. So essentially, we're back to something like the Minsk agreements of February 2022.

Ukraine, on the other hand, doesn't believe Russia will stop. So again, I was just chatting this week to M. Paka, a presidential advisor, and he said, "Why would they? They haven't got what they wanted, and they're still pushing." But he thinks, I mean, this is the Ukrainians really hope that as soon as Trump starts to understand the real picture, as soon as he realizes the Putin of 2016 is no more, there's a different Putin, a more aggressive Putin, a more confident Putin, that Trump would eventually move to a position that is more favorable to Ukraine. So the idea of these two alpha males jostling for position—Putin wants to be number one, Trump obviously will not want to be number two—so in this sense, actually, a strong-armed proposal by Trump might offer Zelensky a way out. He could say, "Brothers and sisters, this is the brave new world. We don't really have a choice." But to be honest, I don't think Zelensky himself is in a psychological position to do that at the moment.

You say it might offer Ukraine a way out, but do we have any sense of what a plan could be? Yeah, so I mean, basically, before the election, there were two published plans, and this is what Ukraine had been working off. The first was associated with Vice President-elect JD Vance, and that was essentially freezing the conflict on the current lines, forcing Ukraine into a sense of neutrality without any sense of any security guarantees or checks on Putin. Obviously, it's a very unpopular position in Ukraine. That's position number one. A second position came from Mike Pompeo, the former Secretary of State, and that was more palatable to Ukrainians. It was the idea about creating a surge—more weapons, more money—that would boost Ukraine's standing. Perhaps even there would be the offer of NATO membership. There, of course, Ukrainians are much happier with this proposal. But the fact that Trump has publicly pushed Pompeo out of the picture doesn't look fantastic from Ukraine's standpoint. And the top security official I was speaking to this week said it was a really negative development that now they were thinking that actually they might be pushed more towards the Vance proposal, which looks essentially like territorial concessions, NATO out of the picture. What they were hoping was there would be some kind of security guarantee, and they're worried about that. They might try and take European Union membership, and Russia essentially forcing the militarization on them, and that's unacceptable for Ukraine.

And is there anything to stop him going for the Vance proposal, territorial concessions? A lot still has to be played out, but I think that wholesale sellout is unlikely. The news that Trump might be appointing Mike Waltz and Marco Rubio into top security and state positions, both of whom have been moderately hawkish towards Russia in the past at certain points, at the very least, that's been more welcomed in Ukraine. Ukraine presented what they called a victory plan just before the elections. It was presented first of all to Joe Biden, but also to Donald Trump. But they inserted clauses which suggested that the US might be given some control of certain natural resources, for example, and that Ukrainian troops might be sent to replace US troops in Europe. So Ukraine feels it has a chance. It feels if Zelensky can get in Trump's ear, if he can do this while Trump is figuring out where he stands on the issue, they have a chance. I think the problem is that Russia understands this too, and Russia has better resources, and it is better at working Washington and the Republican Party to its interest. History has shown that. So I think it will require a huge effort from Ukraine and from Ukraine's partners to overturn this disadvantage.

OE, isn't it an incredibly precarious moment for Ukraine? Russia continues to move forward. Ukraine is not on the front foot, and now we have no idea what's going to happen. Yeah, totally. I mean, I think the East, you know, Russia is at the moment surging, throwing everything it has at its assaults. There's been a huge blood cost for Russia. British military say 1,500 killed and wounded in action a day, and so there is a question how long that can last. The sad reality is that we've been asking this question for the whole of the last year, and throughout that year of Russia's offensive, they have been recruiting more men than they had been losing. They are growing their forces, unlike Ukraine, and Ukraine's likely to be in retreat for the rest of the year, probably very soon from K, which is a stronghold just outside of Donetsk, and then they'll probably turn to Pakos. We've been speaking about that quite a lot recently, an important coal mining town and a transport hub. And parallel to that, Russia is also apparently gearing up for an assault on Zaporizhzhia, which would be incredibly damaging to Ukraine's industrial base. It's an important industrial hub.

So this short-term problem has been about Ukrainian men and management. We have a breakdown in authority, a breakdown in morale, tensions between part of the army which is young, technocratic, and ready to experiment, and a general class which is less so. It was put to me by an intelligence source that the generals were trying to increase milk production by milking the cow for twice as long, how we put it. And people in the rear see that, and that's creating a sort of weakness in the rear. They don't want to go to the front lines to die. Huge deserter numbers. So there really couldn't be more on the line here. In a way, that challenge of Trump is just the icing on the cake for a country that's three years into war, whose very existence still lies very much in the balance.

Olle, thank you for talking to me. I'm sure we will talk again soon. It's always a pleasure.

The Yoruba songs that you're hearing now are from a church service, part of a praise and worship segment that would typically open the service at a Pentecostal church like this one. And this specific church is a branch of Nigeria's Redeemed Christian Church of God. But this church isn't in Lagos
