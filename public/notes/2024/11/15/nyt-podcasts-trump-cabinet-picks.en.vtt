is<00:31:26.799><c> right</c><00:31:27.519><c> and</c>

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
is right and
 

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.310 align:start position:0%
is right and
I<00:31:28.559><c> think</c><00:31:28.720><c> he's</c><00:31:29.039><c> on</c><00:31:29.399><c> has</c><00:31:29.519><c> a</c><00:31:29.639><c> good</c><00:31:29.799><c> relationship</c>

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
I think he's on has a good relationship
 

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.149 align:start position:0%
I think he's on has a good relationship
with<00:31:30.440><c> Rubio</c><00:31:31.000><c> in</c><00:31:31.080><c> the</c><00:31:31.200><c> Senate</c><00:31:31.519><c> but</c><00:31:31.720><c> obviously</c>

00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
with Rubio in the Senate but obviously
 

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:33.950 align:start position:0%
with Rubio in the Senate but obviously
they<00:31:32.320><c> have</c><00:31:32.480><c> differences</c><00:31:32.919><c> on</c><00:31:33.080><c> foreign</c><00:31:33.399><c> policy</c>

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
they have differences on foreign policy
 

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.269 align:start position:0%
they have differences on foreign policy
so<00:31:34.200><c> I</c><00:31:34.360><c> I</c><00:31:34.440><c> think</c><00:31:34.600><c> the</c><00:31:34.760><c> Vance</c><00:31:35.200><c> role</c><00:31:35.799><c> remains</c><00:31:36.120><c> to</c>

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
so I I think the Vance role remains to
 

00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:38.789 align:start position:0%
so I I think the Vance role remains to
be<00:31:36.440><c> seen</c><00:31:37.039><c> but</c><00:31:37.720><c> the</c><00:31:38.000><c> the</c><00:31:38.120><c> one</c><00:31:38.320><c> other</c><00:31:38.559><c> thing</c>

00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
be seen but the the one other thing
 

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:41.350 align:start position:0%
be seen but the the one other thing
about<00:31:39.399><c> Vance</c><00:31:39.919><c> is</c><00:31:40.039><c> that</c><00:31:40.200><c> we</c><00:31:40.360><c> haven't</c><00:31:40.639><c> seen</c><00:31:41.159><c> a</c>

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.549 align:start position:0%
about Vance is that we haven't seen a
