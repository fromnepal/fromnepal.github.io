here are four points on my odometer, can you make a nice markdown table and put it inside three ticks like ```this``` for easy copy pasting and tell me what the difference between these points are in another column? 
75.5 miles
141.9 miles
208.3 miles
280.6 miles





Hereâ€™s a markdown table with the odometer points and the differences between each point:

```
| Odometer Point | Difference from Previous Point |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 75.5 miles     | -                             |
| 141.9 miles    | 66.4 miles                    |
| 208.3 miles    | 66.4 miles                    |
| 280.6 miles    | 72.3 miles                    |
```

### Explanation of Differences:
- The difference between 75.5 miles and 141.9 miles is **66.4 miles**.
- The difference between 141.9 miles and 208.3 miles is also **66.4 miles**.
- The difference between 208.3 miles and 280.6 miles is **72.3 miles**.





Sure! Here's a markdown table with the odometer points and the differences between them:

```
| Odometer Point (miles) | Difference (miles) |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| 75.5                   | -                  |
| 141.9                  | 66.4               |
| 208.3                  | 66.4               |
| 280.6                  | 72.3               |
```

The differences between the points are calculated as follows:
- From 75.5 to 141.9: \(141.9 - 75.5 = 66.4\) miles
- From 141.9 to 208.3: \(208.3 - 141.9 = 66.4\) miles
- From 208.3 to 280.6: \(280.6 - 208.3 = 72.3\) miles
