<p class="drop-cap">The average US citizen estimates that </p>
<ul>
  <li>Every fifth US citizen is transgender.</li>
  <li>Every fourth US household has an income of over 500,000$.</li>
  <li>Every third US citizen is gay or lesbian.</li>
  <li>Every second US citizen is either muslimic or jewish.</li>
  <li>Nearly half of the US population is black.</li>
  <li>Every third adult US citizen is unionized.</li>
  <li>One in three adult US citizens has finished high school.</li>
</ul>

<p>This has the fingerprints of a massive structural media bias combined with a poor education system all over it, though the study delivers a different explanation. </p>
<p>I think it would be quite difficult for a population this disinformed making grounded democratic decisions.</p>

<p>"When people’s average perceptions of group sizes are compared to actual population estimates, an intriguing pattern emerges: Americans tend to vastly overestimate the size of minority groups. </p>
<p>This holds for sexual minorities, including the proportion of gays and lesbians (estimate: 30%, true: 3%), bisexuals (estimate: 29%, true: 4%), and people who are transgender (estimate: 21%, true: 0.6%).</p>
<p></p>
<p>It also applies to religious minorities, such as Muslim Americans (estimate: 27%, true: 1%) and Jewish Americans (estimate: 30%, true: 2%). And we find the same sorts of overestimates for racial and ethnic minorities, such as Native Americans (estimate: 27%, true: 1%), Asian Americans (estimate: 29%, true: 6%), and Black Americans (estimate: 41%, true: 12%)."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The study's explanation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Why is demographic math so difficult? One recent meta-study suggests that when people are asked to make an estimation they are uncertain about, such as the size of a population, they tend to rescale their perceptions in a rational manner. When a person’s lived experience suggests an extreme value — such as a small proportion of people who are Jewish or a large proportion of people who are Christian — they often assume, reasonably, that their experiences are biased. In response, they adjust their prior estimate of a group’s size accordingly by shifting it closer to what they perceive to be the mean group size (that is, 50%). This can facilitate misestimation in surveys, such as ours, which don’t require people to make tradeoffs by constraining the sum of group proportions within a certain category to 100%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This reasoning process — referred to as uncertainty-based rescaling — leads people to systematically overestimate the size of small values and underestimate the size of large values. It also explains why estimates of populations closer to 0% (e.g., LGBT people, Muslims, and Native Americans) and populations closer to 100% (e.g., adults with a high school degree or who own a car) are less accurate than estimates of populations that are closer to 50%, such as the percentage of American adults who are married or have a child."</p>
