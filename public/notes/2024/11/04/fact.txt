Prompt: What fact are you Just TIRED of explaining to people?

Person A: You cannot get a raise and wind up with a lower net income because of taxes.

Income taxes are progressive. The higher bracket does not apply to the money you make under the threshold.

(This is different from the welfare cliff, which is very real.)

Person B: I once argued this with a coworker. They insisted they made less after a raise. I convinced them to show proof and what really happened is they increased their 401k contributions in an attempt to reduce taxes and overshot. They still didn’t believe me that their missing money was really in their retirement account and not going to taxes.


Person C: People really don't like being wrong.

Person D: what really pisses me off is people come up with something literally in 3 seconds in their head then will go to their grave defending it. they refuse to take in new information and allow themselves to be wrong, worst kind of people

Person E: We talked about this a lot in education courses, especially pertaining to science. Kids will make a few connections and come up with a plausible (to a five year old) explanation for how the world works, and that can stick with them forever. Even after showing these misconceptions to be false through a bunch of simple experiments, students will default to their toddler hypothesis. They might learn the material well enough to answer a test question, but actually breaking them of their baby logic and cartoon physics is extremely difficult.

Person F: This might explain why my Grade 9 science teacher told me that electrons flow from positive to negative in a circuit. Even when I broke out the textbook to show the opposite.

Like, I don't know if he was mixing up conventional circuit flow or if he was just being an asshole. I really don't.

But then again this is the same guy that asked us to write our tests in pencil then wouldn't correct a marking mistake on the the table of elements he had made and accused me of erasing and rewriting it. Some people are just wads I suppose.

Person G: Probably he was trying to not go above a grade 9 level (or maybe he didn't know enough about it himself).

The reason why this is complicated is because of something called the Franklin convention, named after Benjamin Franklin, who basically conjectured wrong about the way electrons flow (positive to negative). This convention is what is used for drawing circuits (positive to negative) and became popularized and it wasn't until way later that we learned that electrons are actually negatively charged and are thus going to flow to positives (opposites attract, you are correct on that). So when we draw circuits, the current isn't really showing the flow of electrons, but rather "positively charged holes" between the electrons flowing the opposite way. The distinction doesn't really matter much, but it is an unnecessary barrier to understanding.

So, in a strange way, you were both right.

Person F: No, I choose to remember myself as being right from a conversation over 20 years ago. How dare you bring a reasonable explanation to this!

I'm going to read up in that a bit though, thanks.

Person H: This made me laugh, thank you

### Reading Level Analysis

1. **Original Prompt:**
   - **Reading Level:** Approximately

please continue

Sure, let's continue with the reading level analysis.

### Reading Level Analysis

1. **Original Prompt:**
   - **Reading Level:** Approximately 8th to 9th grade. The language is straightforward, but some concepts like progressive taxes and the Franklin convention might require a higher level of understanding.

2. **Copilot Edit:**
   - **Reading Level:** Approximately 8th to 9th grade. The edit maintains the original structure and complexity, with minor grammatical improvements that do not significantly alter the reading level.

3. **GPT-4o Mini Edit:**
   - **Reading Level:** Approximately 9th to 10th grade. This version includes more complex sentence structures and additional punctuation, which slightly raises the reading level. The explanations are more detailed, particularly in Person G's response, which might require a higher level of comprehension.

### Summary

- **Original Prompt:** Clear and concise, suitable for a general audience with a basic understanding of the topics discussed.
- **Copilot Edit:** Maintains the original clarity and readability, with minor grammatical enhancements.
- **GPT-4o Mini Edit:** Slightly more advanced due to more complex sentence structures and detailed explanations, making it suitable for readers with a higher reading level.

Both edits improve the original prompt's readability and clarity, but the GPT-4o Mini Edit provides a more polished and detailed version, which might be more engaging for readers with a higher reading level.
