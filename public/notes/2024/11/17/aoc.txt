of all the confounding results in this past election perhaps the strangest phenomenon was the surprising number of people who voted for Democrats down ballot and then checked off Donald Trump for president that was the case in New York's 14th District a number of Voters cast their ballot for both Trump and one of the House's most Progressive Democrats congresswoman Alexandro acasio Cortez better known as AOC and while the Democratic party is still reeling from the results congresswoman Ocasio Cortez is doing something a lot of the DC folks aren't doing which is talking to social media and actually talking to voters to figure out why this happened if you voted for Donald Trump and me or if you voted for Donald Trump and voted Democratic down ballot I would really love to hear from you um this is not a place of judgment I'm not going to like put your stuff on blast or anything like that or dunk on it that's like genuinely not the intent here I actually want to learn from you I want to hear what you were thinking and um I just want to hear from you joining me now is the aforementioned democratic congresswoman Alexandri Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York okay alc what they say I mean there's a lot of different things that we saw I think there's a lot of people first of all it's important to note that Democrats often times when we lose elections we think that we lost people to Trump and that is true in in circumstances but they don't look enough that at the fact that we also lost people to the couch MH we have two people that we running against so a lot of people say this is why I voted for you and Trump and some people say this is why I didn't vote or didn't vote top of the ticket right skip the top of the ticket which by the way there's been a lot of paranoia about the fact that Democrats were able to win Statewide in some places while Comm haris lost and I keep trying to tell people there are voters who go in and either just vote the top Trump voters who will say I just want Trump don't care about Republicans and the reverse you say I'm not voting top of the ticket but I'll vote everybody else right right and we I think we saw some of that happen as well um but when it comes to people who split their ticket I think a lot of people cited several different things one is there is universal frustration in this country much of it actually think Justified that is Raging at a political establishment that centers corporate interests billionaires and puts their needs ahead of the needs of working Americans and we know that we can either Channel this righteous rage because there are people whose snap was cut off their child tax credits were cut off but they're seeing people like Elon Musk getting tax breaks and kissing up to Donald Trump in order to do so but they vote for then why vote for Elon Musk and Donald Trump and I think that of course is the question makes no sense and I think part of it has to do with the fact that and I think we're still in a process of going through the data it's important to say that yes and I actually think that it's important to say that the people who are rushing to to say let me give you my grand theory of what's going on right now problem to woke sorry K Harris was running with Liz Cheney at her side she wasn't going quote unquote woke if we had an election on November 5th and November 6th you've got an answer don't listen to those people I agreed do not listen to those people so I want to have the I want to say that we should all have the humility of saying this is an ongoing learning process however there is something to be said about it doesn't matter that he's lying he's saying that I'm fighting for you in all of this debate that people are talking about with this woke thing right oh my gosh uh it's because we care about trans people and that's why by only Donald Trump cared about trans people because he was the one running $130 Million worth of ads the Harris campaign said nothing about this issue that's right that's right and listen the ads it's not to even deny the fact that these ads were effective in certain areas what I think people are paying too much attention to is the first half of that ADH which says KLA Harris is or that said KLA Harris is for they them everyone's focusing on that they're not focusing on the second half of that ad where he said Donald Trump is for you yeah yeah and Democrats very often in their messaging they speak and in this in terms and in Concepts and not in the second person I care about you and political races are not about one candidate versus another candidate too often it gets pigeon ho hold like that it is a race to convince a person about who cares about you more Let me let me ask you this question because we've been talking a lot about AR Jr my mind is a bit blown I mean I we I we knew that Donald Trump would go would go wild there's no constraints on him he could just he can just put all his friends in but we're talking about RFK Jr and the possibility of people pulling back on measles V vines on another pandemic happening you're talking about Matt Gates there's a 17-year-old girl out there terrified that all of her records all of the witnesses against him in this case where she was trafficked could be in the hands of Matt Gates and he could be the most powerful law enforcement official in the country in a case where the president of the United States is an adjudicated sexual abuser if you're a sexual assault Survivor you're thinking oh my God this country is out to get me they're out to get me and force me to have children by seexual assault so the the message to women has been in in insane okay and the people he's nominating are TV hosts Etc do you think the people who voted for him that you've talked to were expecting this no no or or or true Mass deportation genuinely genuinely yeah no and it's heartbreaking actually it it is it is heartbreaking and people may want to take like a a kind of vengeful stance about this but it is genuinely heartbreaking people need to understand that there are people millions of people in this country and I was one of them where you are working two three shifts a day to try to make ends me you're not reading the newspaper every morning with a cup of coffee yeah you're not and it's not to say that people are uneducated or uninformed or anything like that but like this is real life this is real life you got a baby on your hip and you've got two three shifts to work in that day and you're just trying to make things work and you have such overwhelm of information and I actually think something that is different about this moment than I saw whether it was 2020 or 20 after 2016 is that almost like right the day after people immediately said we're coming to me and saying he's not actually going to do that right and it's important to say people people may often say he said he was going to do this it was right here on the campaign Trail if you actually listen to him if you listen to Donald Trump's acceptance speech spe when he talked about immigration he talked about legal Pathways first yeah yeah he didn't say he he didn't lead with mass deportation AB okay I'm gonna I'm going to hold you we're going to hold you over if you don't mind we're gonna hold for one more we're going to take a quick break pay for all of this uh and then when we come back AOC will still be right here with me stay right there Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is back with me um we were talking uh a little bit about the the the shock that people are feeling about not really thinking Donald Trump was going to do the things he was doing let's talk about Mass deportation do you think the 55% of Latino men the 40 some odd per of Latinos thought he was really going to do it no I think what is interesting kind of what what we were discussing earlier is that one of the things that I learned when I was asking about people who voted for Donald Trump and me I asked them where do you get your news from how do you like take in information right and one of the things that they said is that one of their primary trusted sources of information was they said you as in me yeah that means that they rely on me as their elected official for information directly it also means that they are listening to him directly for his information and as we said earlier he in Donald Trump's victory speech he said that when he talked about immigration the first thing that he talked about was legal Pathways he talked about Mass deportation afterwards and so I think people who believe what he says when he says we're only going after criminals they think that he's going after somebody else meanwhile the Republican Party the Trump campaign people like step Miller yeah they believe that being undocumented means you are a criminal right right and and they don't understand that I want to talk a couple talk about a couple of the pics that you know as you said people may not have saw coming Matt Gates you've had to deal with him uh as a a member of Congress How concerned are you about him being attorney general you know I think right now the mood on the hill you know there's a lot of Republican uproar about it I find it interesting too it's important to note that Matt Gates won general election to the 119th Congress so he resigned his seat that he just won just for to finish this term yeah the seat that he just won starts in January right so he may just be away from Congress for 2 months yeah potentially just to expunge this ethics report do you think it'll come out the ethics report well I think there's a large Juris jurisdiction I don't know if the Ethics Committee has a legal grounds now to release it I do wonder if the Senate would subpoena it in order to understand and make a full uh have a fully informed decision yeah uh s similar to I think when you had justice Kavanaugh with credible sexual assault allegations and there was an FBI report and that whole investigation is is something else you know a different matter but the Senate it was still relevant to a senate confirmation hearing and so I I think that's an open question as to whether the Senate would um subpoena it I wonder if the Democratic Senate majority now would be able to to do that uh as well I don't know these are open legal questions to not fear that then he would be confirmed and then go after them um let's talk about RFK Jr and we we were talking a little bit in the break let's bring that forward to TV some of the concerns you have about what he might do to HHS yeah I think it's what's very important too is that yes there are these concerns about vac you have a baby and anywhere in the world I mean protecting against polio against measles against very serious communicable diseases that I mean we would be talking about going back to the what 1700 1800 I mean this is serious but on top of that if you're a republican that voted for Donald Trump you believe in in his agenda yeah something that is broadly popular among Republicans and and Democrats are community health centers if you live in a rural area and there's not a hospital very close to you but there is a community center closer to you it could be decimated under Robert F Kennedy and we are talking about people who live in rural communities we're talking about people who live in underserved communities that have been neglected in order to whether it's to get a shot or just to get checked up on sure you we're talking about the potential decimation of Community Health centers and we haven't even gotten to tulsey gabard potentially having access to National Security information and Russia loves it loves her and I actually think almost more than Matt Gates telsey gabbard's appointment yeah is devastating and Chelsea gabbard's nomination as much as she says that she's an anti-war person she's not yeah she supports very pro-war individuals including in Syria and let's be very clear a Tulsi gabard nomination is a proar nomination globally Point Blank period as is uh Donald Trump as president of the United States uh Congressman Alexandri acasio Cortez thank you so much much appreciated thank you and
