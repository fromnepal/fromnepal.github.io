Alright, I've been asked to list all the current and past members of these K-pop groups—TWICE, New Jeans, FIFTY FIFTY, LE SSERAFIM, IZ*ONE, Red Velvet, fromis_9, and SNSD (Girls' Generation)—sorted by their date of birth, starting with the oldest. I need to present this information in a markdown table for easy copying.

First, I need to gather the names of all the members from each group. The user has already provided a list, which is great. I'll double-check to ensure I haven't missed anyone.

**TWICE:**

- Nayeon

- Jeongyeon

- Momo

- Sana

- Jihyo

**SNSD (Girls' Generation):**

- Taeyeon

- Sunny

- Tiffany

- Hyoyeon

- Yuri

- Sooyoung

- Yoona

- Seohyun

Wait, I notice that there are two members named Park Jiwon in fromis_9. I need to confirm if they are the same person or if there are indeed two members with the same name. After a quick check, it seems there are two Park Jiwons in fromis_9, so I'll keep both.

Next, I need to find the dates of birth for each member. I should make sure to get accurate birthdates to correctly sort them by age.

I'll start with SNSD (Girls' Generation) since they're one of the older groups.

**SNSD (Girls' Generation):**

- Taeyeon: March 9, 1989

- Sunny: January 28, 1988

- Tiffany: April 11, 1988

- Hyoyeon: March 14, 1989

- Yuri: February 21, 1988

- Sooyoung: March 10, 1989

- Yoona: March 29, 1989

- Seohyun: June 16, 1991

So, for SNSD, Sunny is the oldest, born in 1988, followed by Yuri, Tiffany, Taeyeon, Hyoyeon, Sooyoung, Yoona, and Seohyun is the youngest in the group.

Moving on to Red Velvet.

**Red Velvet:**

- Irene: October 29, 1991

- Seulgi: April 1, 1992

- Wendy: August 25, 1995

- Joy: June 21, 1996

- Yeri: March 16, 1997

So, in Red Velvet, Irene is the oldest, followed by Seulgi, then Wendy, Joy, and Yeri is the youngest.

Now, IZ*ONE. This group had a shorter run, and many members were from different companies before.

**IZ*ONE:**

- Jang Wonyoung: June 15, 1995

- Miyawaki Sakura: September 22, 1997

- Jo Yuri: August 22, 1997

Here, Jang Wonyoung is the oldest, followed by Miyawaki Sakura and Jo Yuri, then Choi Yena, Ahn Yujin, Nako Yabuki, and the youngest are Kwon Eunbi, Kang Hyewon, Hitomi Honda, Kim Chaewon, and Lee Chaeyeon.

LE SSERAFIM is a newer group, so their members might be younger.

**LE SSERAFIM:**

- Kim Chaewon: March 24, 2000

- Sakura: September 22, 1997

- Huh Yunjin: June 13, 1998

- Kazuha: October 15, 2000

So, Sakura is the oldest in LE SSERAFIM, followed by Huh Yunjin, Kim Chaewon, Kazuha, and Hong Eunchae is the youngest.

FIFTY FIFTY is another group I need to look into.

**FIFTY FIFTY:**

- Reina: April 16, 1998

- Aran: June 18, 1999

- Keena: October 20, 1999

- Sio: March 23, 2001

Therefore, Reina is the oldest, followed by Aran, Keena, and Sio is the youngest.

NewJeans is a very new group, so I expect their members to be younger.

**NewJeans:**

- Minji: November 19, 2001

- Hanni: June 17, 2002

- Danielle: August 13, 2003

- Haerin: December 24, 2003

- Hyein: October 12, 2004

So, Minji is the oldest in NewJeans, followed by Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein is the youngest.

In TWICE, Nayeon and Jeongyeon are the oldest, both born in 1992, followed by Jihyo, Momo, Mina, Sana, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu.

Lastly, fromis_9.

- Baek Jiheon: March 29, 1997

- Park Jiwon (2): April 15, 1997

- Lee Seoyeon: May 29, 1997

So, in fromis_9, Lee Saerom and Song Hayoung are the oldest, both born in 1995, followed by Park Jiwon (1), Roh Jisun, Lee Chaeyoung, Lee Nagyung, Baek Jiheon, Park Jiwon (2), and Lee Seoyeon.

Starting with 1988:

1. Sunny (SNSD): January 28,
