I would like to generate a new database in postgresql 17. 
I want you to come up with sensible table definitions for me for a contact book application. 
The purpose of this application is to store contact information of people, companies, and such entities. 
A contact can have zero or more phone numbers, each phone number could have meta data such as country code such as 1 for the United States and Canada and a label such as home but a label does not mean it is unique for example a person might have two phone numbers with the same label home. 
A contact can also have zero or more addresses. We can't assume the address is in the US and we want a label for each address. 
Same for email addresses as well as social media links such as linked in, twitter, blue sky, facebook, instagram, twitter etc 
I would like each table to have both a unique serial id as well as a uuid. 
I would also like each table to have audit columns such as created by, created at, modified by, modified at. 
Also is it possible to have these tables be as normalized as possible to the highest normal form you can get them to? 
also is it possible to somehow save old data when data is modified? how? 
please generate all the table sql for me thank you.
