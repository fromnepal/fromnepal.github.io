that's good now can you add select * for all tables including history tables? 

Sure! Here are the `SELECT *` statements for all the tables, including the history tables:

```sql
-- Select all from contacts
select * from contacts;

-- Select all from phone_numbers
select * from phone_numbers;

-- Select all from addresses
select * from addresses;

-- Select all from email_addresses
select * from email_addresses;

-- Select all from social_media_links
select * from social_media_links;

-- Select all from phone_numbers_history
select * from phone_numbers_history;

-- Select all from addresses_history
select * from addresses_history;

-- Select all from email_addresses_history
select * from email_addresses_history;

-- Select all from social_media_links_history
select * from social_media_links_history;
```

These queries will retrieve all columns and rows from each table. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
