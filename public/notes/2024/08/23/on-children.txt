If you genuinely believe that you can’t do a particular job, you shouldn’t have to do that job.

Today, I want to talk about parenting. Many people might object to calling parenting a job, arguing that it is the greatest pleasure of life. However, one thing is certain: not everyone should be a parent. Some parents, despite raising multiple children, are unable to fulfill the basic duties of parenting. This isn't about financial capability but about the ability to provide a nurturing environment.

In the past, my grandparents likely had no choice about having children, and my parents faced significant peer pressure from family and society. However, I have the freedom to decide for myself, considering not just my well-being but also the potential well-being of my children.

### Factors Influencing Parenting Ability

Parenting is influenced by a variety of factors, including parent characteristics, child characteristics, and contextual and sociocultural characteristics. Parent characteristics such as age, personality, mental and physical health, and knowledge about child development play a significant role in parenting behaviors. For instance, parents who are more agreeable and less anxious tend to provide a more structured and supportive environment for their children.

Child characteristics, such as temperament and health status, also impact parenting. A child with a difficult temperament can make parenting more challenging, leading to increased stress and potentially less effective parenting. Parenting is a bidirectional process where both parents and children influence each other.

### Societal Support for Parenting

The role of societal support in parenting cannot be overstated. Organizations like Parents Helping Parents provide crucial support through stress lines, virtual support groups, and community programs. These resources help parents navigate the challenges of raising children by offering empathy, encouragement, and practical advice.

### Economic Factors Affecting Parenting

Economic stability is another critical factor in effective parenting. Economic disparities can significantly impact a child's development. Families with lower incomes often face greater challenges in providing a supportive environment for their children. Economic pressures can negatively affect parental mental health, marital interactions, and overall parenting effectiveness.

### Impact of Parenting on Child Development

Parenting styles have a profound impact on child development. Research has identified four primary parenting styles: authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and uninvolved. Each style has different effects on children's behavior and development. For example, authoritative parenting, characterized by high responsiveness and high demands, is generally associated with positive child outcomes, including higher self-esteem and better academic performance.

### Societal Expectations of Parenting

Societal expectations also play a significant role in shaping parenting practices. In the United States, parents often face pressure to ensure their children achieve academic success and financial independence. These expectations can lead to increased stress and anxiety among parents, making the already challenging task of parenting even more difficult.

### Demographic Changes in the United States

The United States is undergoing significant demographic changes that impact parenting and family dynamics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the year 2030 marks a demographic turning point for the country. By that year, all baby boomers will be older than 65, expanding the size of the older population so that one in every five Americans will be of retirement age. By 2034, older adults are projected to outnumber children for the first time in U.S. history.

Additionally, immigration is projected to overtake natural increase (the excess of births over deaths) as the primary driver of population growth by 2030. The U.S. population is expected to grow slowly, age considerably, and become more racially and ethnically diverse. Despite slowing population growth, the U.S. population is still expected to grow by 79 million people by 2060, crossing the 400 million threshold in 2058.

### Global Demographic Changes

Globally, the world population passed eight billion people in November 2022 and is expected to reach nine billion by 2040. The world's total population has increased rapidly over the past century due to medical advancements and increasing standards of living, which have slowed infant mortality and led to longer life expectancies.

Several key demographic trends are shaping the world. For instance, India is projected to overtake China as the most populous country by 2037. More than 50 countries will see fertility rates fall below replacement level, and climate change is expected to drive migration within and between countries. Population aging is another defining demographic trend, with governments worldwide working to establish systems to support the well-being of older adults.

### Demographic Changes in Specific Countries

#### Japan
Japan's population is expected to more than halve, from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Japan already has the world's oldest population and the highest rate of people over the age of 100. This has put a strain on the country's workforce, and the problem is only expected to worsen. Official forecasts say elderly people will account for more than 35% of the population by 2040. This, combined with a low fertility rate of just 1.4 births per woman, means that the number of people able to fill jobs in the country is in decline. While Japan has traditionally been wary of immigration, it has eased rules in recent years in a bid to deal with the issue.

#### Italy
The Italian population is also expected to more than halve, from 61 million in 2017 to 28 million by the end of the century. Like Japan, Italy is known for its aging population. More than 23% of people there were over the age of 65 in 2019. In 2015, the government launched a program offering an €800 payment per couple per birth to try to boost fertility rates. However, they still remain among the lowest rates in the European Union. The country also sees high rates of emigration. About 157,000 people left the country in 2018. Several towns have introduced their own schemes to try to boost local populations and their economies, including selling homes for just €1 or even paying people to live in under-populated communities.

#### China
China, the world's most populous country, is facing major declines in birth rates. The population is expected to peak at 1.4 billion in four years' time before nearly halving to 732 million by 2100. This dramatic decline is partly due to the one-child policy introduced in 1979, which has led to a significant gender imbalance and an aging population. The Chinese government has since relaxed the policy, allowing families to have up to three children, but the birth rate continues to decline.

#### Nigeria
Nigeria is one of the few countries bucking the trend of population decline. The country's population is expected to grow significantly, from 206 million in 2020 to 401 million by 2050, making it the third most populous country in the world. This rapid population growth presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, a youthful population can drive economic growth and innovation. On the other hand, it can strain resources and infrastructure if not managed properly.

### Personal Reflection

What kind of quality of life can I provide for my children? Is it compassionate to have children when I am not confident in giving them a good life? It isn’t enough for me that my children merely survive; I want them to thrive. Reflecting on the hardships my parents faced and the better life they provided for me, I question whether I can offer my children the same, let alone an improved quality of life.

For me, the answer is a clear and resounding no. My wife and I cannot provide the quality of life that we believe our children deserve.

### Conclusion

I believe more people should consider not having children until societal conditions improve. Currently, the responsibility placed on parents is overwhelming. Children are not the personal property of their parents; they are individuals with their own rights. Moreover, today's children will shape the world of tomorrow. It is the duty of society to equip every child with the tools they need to succeed.

It takes a village to raise a child. If the village is not willing to do its part, parents should reconsider bringing children into the world.
