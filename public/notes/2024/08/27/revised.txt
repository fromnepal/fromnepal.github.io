Federal prosecutors on Tuesday issued a revised version of an indictment accusing former President Donald J. Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, stripping out some charges in order to help it survive the Supreme Court’s recent ruling granting former presidents broad immunity for official acts in office.

The new indictment came just days before Mr. Trump’s lawyers and prosecutors in the office of the special counsel, Jack Smith, were scheduled to provide the judge overseeing the case with their separate proposals for how to assess the impact on the case of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision.

It was not immediately clear how the new indictment would affect how that assessment will now move forward.
