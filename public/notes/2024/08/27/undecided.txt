Why Some Young, Undecided Voters Changed Their Minds About Kamala Harris After Her Speech

Mr. Healy is the deputy Opinion editor.

This summer, Times Opinion organized a new project to follow a group of young, undecided voters through the election, and we kicked it off just before the Democratic National Convention with a wide-ranging discussion about Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The group had very specific opinions about Mr. Trump. The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was searing for many of them, some of whom were teenagers at the time, and they held Mr. Trump responsible. They called him a traitor, a narcissist, untrustworthy. Some worried he would fight another election loss.

And yet the group was even more negative about Ms. Harris.

When we asked them to rate Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump on a scale of zero to 10 (with zero being extremely negative), Ms. Harris got mostly 3s; she did no better than a 5. Mr. Trump got mostly 4s and 5s and topped out with a 7.
