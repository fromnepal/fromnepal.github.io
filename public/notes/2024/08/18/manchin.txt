“I didn’t like being a senator,” Joe Manchin told me last week — quite the statement from arguably the most influential senator of the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris era. But he’s also been the most divisive member of the Senate Democratic caucus: too conservative for the left on party priorities like abortion, climate change and voting rights and too unyielding on the filibuster. Now he’s had enough. He left the party in May to become an independent, and he’s leaving the Senate in January.

But he’s not done trying to make a case that the path to victory in November and beyond runs through the nation’s political center. And he has high hopes for Harris, the Democrats’ new nominee — indeed, more insights and words of praise about her than I expected.

Just days before the Democratic convention in Chicago, the West Virginia senator and I sat down for a Zoom chat about his assessment of his former party and the Republicans, the path he sees for Ms. Harris, his flirtation with a third-party presidential run, how he sees bipartisanship today and the sort of cross-aisle relationship building he seeks to foster on Almost Heaven, the houseboat he keeps in Washington. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
