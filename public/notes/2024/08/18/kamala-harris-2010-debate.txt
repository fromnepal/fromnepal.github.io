The 47 Seconds That Saved Kamala Harris’s Political Career

Nearly 14 years ago, Kamala Harris’s opponent in the California attorney general’s race gave an answer at a little-watched debate that was frank — and fateful for the future Democratic presidential nominee.

The first thing to know about Kamala Harris’s campaign for California attorney general is that she was not necessarily favored to win.

It was 2010 — the pinnacle of the Tea Party’s power — and Ms. Harris was running statewide for the first time and struggling to shed the same San Francisco liberal label that Donald J. Trump is yet again wielding as an epithet.

Ms. Harris, then 45, was already seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party. “The female Barack Obama,” Gwen Ifill had memorably tagged her the year before. But plenty of rising stars are snuffed out early, and Ms. Harris was facing a formidable Republican foe that year in Steve Cooley, the popular and moderate district attorney of Los Angeles County.

An earlier version of this article misstated the day Kamala Harris and Steve Cooley participated in their only debate. It was the first Tuesday of October 2010, not the first Monday.
