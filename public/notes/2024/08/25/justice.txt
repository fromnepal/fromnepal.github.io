By Rachel Louise Snyder
Ms. Snyder is a contributing Opinion writer and the author of the book “No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us.”
In 2018, a Black teenager named Chrystul Kizer shot and killed a 34-year-old white man named Randall Volar III, who had sexually abused and trafficked her starting when she was 16 years old; she was 17 at the time of the killing. This week, a Wisconsin judge sentenced her to 11 years in prison, with another five under supervision. Rather than serving justice, her case illustrates with searing clarity the sexism and racism that corrupt our criminal justice system.
In a 2019 investigation, The Washington Post detailed Ms. Kizer’s life: Her single mother, who struggled to support her four children. The abusive man and the family’s time in a homeless shelter. Ms. Kizer wanted money for snacks and school notebooks, so she placed an ad in an online forum called backpage.com, which was notorious for sex trafficking (it has since been shut down). Mr. Volar was the first one who answered. He showered her with gifts and took her to fancy dinners; she understood there was a price to these extravagances. But before long, she said he was taking her to hotels to have sex with other men. He’d wait outside for her and insist she turn the money over to him. He called himself an “escort trainer.” One night, when he wanted to have sex and she brushed him off, she said she fell to the ground and he jumped on top of her, trying to force off her clothes. She shot him twice in the head, and then, the police said, set his body on fire.
Ms. Kizer’s case has been in the national spotlight since she killed Mr. Volar; a petition to drop her charges garnered more than a million and a half signatures. In what was a major win for her side, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that she could argue that her crime was justified because she was trafficked by Mr. Volar — a groundbreaking ruling for trafficking victims. In order to make that argument, however, she would have to take her chances on a long, difficult, very public trial. Or she could take a plea deal.
Four months before his death, Mr. Volar had been arrested after another young girl called 911 claiming he’d drugged her and was threatening to kill her. The police searched his home and found hundreds of videos of sexual abuse. He had a penchant for Black girls, like Ms. Kizer: hers was among those young faces found in the videos. Mr. Volar was released without bail the same day, pending an investigation. The police saw girls in the videos that looked as young as 12 and 13, and yet, “In many and most of the cases, we didn’t know the age,” prosecutor Michael Graveley told The Post. “So we literally did not know whether we had misdemeanors or felony.”
In other words, the girls were young enough to appear young, but apparently not so young that they warranted priority.
Imagine a Black man, aged 34. Imagine him with videos of young white boys who appear to be 12, 13, 14 years old. Imagine those videos contained footage of grown men having sex with young boys. Imagine that 20 of those videos were shot by the suspect himself. Now tell me: In what world does law enforcement let such a person go free without bail? In what world do investigators hold on to those videos for months, seemingly baffled by the task of finding out the ages of the girls? In what world is the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony an excuse for this level of inaction?
In this world, the one we’ve created, courts and prosecutors have long claimed that young girls seduce men, or consent to abuse, or, have ulterior motives, such as, in Ms. Kizer’s case, killing an unsuspecting man for his fancy car. In this world, Black girls, especially, are routinely over-sexualized by law enforcement and the judiciary: The lead investigator in the case against Mr. Volar wrote of one of Mr. Valor’s victims that she was “prostituting herself out.” He was writing about a 15-year-old.
Beth Richie, author of the classic book, “Compelled to Crime: the Gender Entrapment of Battered Black Women,” told me that racist stereotypes enable court systems to filter out all understanding that a Black woman “could possibly have been a victim of horrendous abuse. She presents as a violent Black woman, not a survivor of gender-based violence.”
Ms. Kizer’s case is not unique. Cyntoia Brown, another young Black woman who made national news, spent 15 years in a Tennessee prison after she killed a man who’d trafficked her when she was 16. Tammy Johnson, also Black, was trafficked starting at age 14 by a boyfriend who later became her pimp. She had to “earn” his love by sleeping with other men and bringing in the money. If she refused, she was beaten with a baseball bat, or a belt buckle or the heel of a shoe. Eventually, another pimp killed one of her clients, and she drove the getaway car. She was convicted and sentenced to life without parole. She served 28 years before her sentence was commuted. Ms. Brown and Ms. Johnson were eventually freed, their sentences finally recognized as egregious injustices. But countless others whose stories we don’t know still languish in prison cells across the U.S.
Ms. Kizer was trying, in the best way she knew, to help her family: She posted the ad on backpage.com so she could buy food and school supplies. Ms. Kizer didn’t know that under federal law, it is illegal to solicit someone under the age of 18 for prostitution. What she did know were the layers of systemic racism embedded into her life: poverty, homelessness, abuse, hunger.
After the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling, she had a choice. She could go to trial and risk getting a life sentence — her life for his, if you didn’t count how he’d already hijacked hers — or take a plea deal and some lesser time to serve. She faced up to 30 years on the plea. But 30 years wasn’t life, at least. She took the plea.
She could have risked a trial, of course. But consider what the world had taught her by then, a poor Black girl with men’s violence and control all around her, with a law-enforcement system that prioritized her abuser’s freedom at the cost of her trauma, a world that said sometimes you were hungry and sometimes you needed school supplies, but no good comes from wanting. For six years her case was in and out of court, all the way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and what did that get her? An impossible gamble. What were the odds she’d prevail, in this world we’ve made for her?

It seems to me that in a country where we celebrate the Second Amendment for the right it gives us to defend ourselves, Ms. Kizer did nothing more than exercise that right. Instead of condemning her to prison, Republican should have been toasting her at their convention. Or does standing your ground apply only to white men?

One of the main aims of sentencing is to send a strong signal that deters others from committing the same crime. The judge is quite clear: if you are trafficked, raped, and abused but you choose to fight back to survive, you will be punished.

It’s a horrible message. It’s a dishonorable one. It deeply tarnishes our justice system.

I've followed this story for a while. It's obviously a story of race, crime and punishment, and victims who strike back. She might be guilty of killing her abuser, but justice demands that she spend no more time behind bars. In fact, the almost 2 years she's been incarcerated is too long. 

Can the governor pardon her already?

I cannot help but think if she had been a white male teen this case would never even have made it to court.

I cannot understand why the man who trafficked her and others was set free, or why investigators wanted to watch those videos and do nothing.

I cannot imagine what Ms. Kizer has been through. We would all urge our daughters, our sisters, our mothers, to do the same thing were they in that situation. She should not be sentenced to prison: she's already been there.

Among the many deeply wrong things about this case is that the act of a 16-year-old could lead to a lifetime in prison, particularly when she shot a man who had been raping her and others. Even it the prosecutors believed that she had planned to kill him (I'm not saying such a belief was justified), the harshness of the planned punishment was outrageous. There is something very cynical about threatening to imprison a child for life and then offering a plea deal resulting in her release from prison at some time when she was still young enough to have a life. If justice could be done via a reduced charge and an 11-year sentence, why wasn't the lesser charge made in the first place? By threatening to take away her entire life, the prosecutors forced her into an no-win decision whereby she will never have the right to defend herself and whereby the people will never know the legal evidence as determined by a court of law. 

Another rationale for a much-reduced charge (certainly not murder) is that the police and prosecutors should never have allowed a proven serial rapist to be out of prison. If he had been in prison, there would have been no killing. The state set up the killing scene and must take responsibility.

Teenagers are notorious for making bad decisions and the inability to predict the consequences of them. This girl apparently had no one to pull her back to safety as her situation grew more and more dire. I have no doubt that the odds were stacked against her, and the justice system along with all the other “systems” have failed her miserably. Will à prison sentence serve her any better?

The human rights of women and girls are still not secured in the US constitution.

Yes, read this sentence again and again and again. 

The United States of America  does not guarantee women the same rights as men.

The equal rights amendment - first introduced in congress in 1923 (!!) is still not part of the constitution in 2024 - more than 100 years later.
On top of that, already established rights of women got taken away.
I am happy to live in a country where gender equality is embedded in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Just another example of how our "justice" system rewards white men of means and punishes the most vulnerable.  I cannot comprehend any reasonable explanation for letting this man go when it was clear he was exploiting and harming young girls, much less why anyone would look at the facts of this case and conclude that the true victim was not acting in self-defense.  It's the same disgusting mindset that blames victims of domestic abuse for not leaving their abusers. This young woman has suffered enough, and her desperate act has prevented that evil man from tormenting even more young girls and women - which is what law enforcement should have done in the first place.  No wonder civilized countries shake their heads at the behavior of people in this so-called 'greatest country in the world."

When I read about this case, I immediately thought about Cyntoia Brown and her eloquent book, “Free Cyntoia: My Search for Redemption in the American Prison System.”  This is a tragic miscarriage of justice. A young girl is trafficked and brutalized by a man whom police did not bother to arrest, so she finally snaps in a form of self-defense from further brutality and sexual violence.  She should not be in jail.  I would hope that the Wisconsin governor intervenes and pardons her. It is the only right thing to do.

Kyle Rittenhouse went to trial in Wisconsin and was acquitted on all charges using a self-defense plea.
Perhaps Ms. Kizer should have gone to jury trial.
One might question though why the plea deal was 11 years and not less.

@Hazlit Whatever happened to the "Self-defense" defense?  This is an injustice, plain and simple.  When White men can shoot an unarmed Black then claim "I was afraid for my life" with no objective basis for that fear and get off, how do we justify this conviction and sentence of a Black girl who has every reason to fear for her life and kills her abuser to defend herself?  Double standard, racism, sexism --- pure and simple injustice.

A man in Texas walked in on another man raping his daughter and killed him.  Beat him to death with his bare hands. He could have restrained him. He could have waited for 'justice'. But he didn't.  He was never arrested or charged with a crime.
The Texas justice system thought his actions were justified. He wasn't called upon in court to provide an excuse - temporary insanity was never an option he had to consider.  This young woman was subjected to multiple beatings, raped and threatened over a long period of time - it started before she was a fully formed adult.  I would imagine her rage would be comparable to that of the father, if not more so.  I find it odd that society will all but applaud the one but condemn the other.

This inaction to protect young girls reminds me of a case that was featured in a CBC podcast called ‘The Band Played On’. The first season profiled a teacher who abused boys. The second season profiled a teacher who abused girls. The lack of action by law enforcement to protect the girls and give them any semblance of Justice was appalling. The teacher was allowed to teach, being moved from school to school, like the church did with pedophile priests. So sad.

@Carmine & Friends So I did the thought experiment of switching up the gender and race of the deceased and the accused and no matter how I look at it, based on how the criminal justice system works, I think a white man killing anyone (whatever gender or race) under the same set of circumstances would probably get a lesser sentence under the “he has suffered enough” and is entitled to defend himself. The only other scenario would be a white woman killing a black man under the same set of facts — I think they would not even have prosecuted her. But if a white woman had killed a white man, I think she would have also faced jail time, but there may have been more incentive for a trial.  But any situation with a black killer (regardless of gender or race of deceased) I think would result in a plea deal with time served. (I also think if you add sexual orientation, again the straight white man killing someone will get greater leniency under these set of facts). So there are issues of both race and gender going on, and who the deceased and accused are affects how the system works and public opinion affects how that system works. Sad but true reality. We have a biased criminal justice system. Being a particular gender and race (or sexual orientation) absolutely affects how “bad” or “justified” and “punishable” you are deemed to be

I also questioned the justice of an 11 year sentence for this woman. It rather feels like she acted in self defense or a it was a crime of passion. I can’t help but believe that this man got what he deserved. I can’t imagine being in her shoes, living what she endured. She killed the criminal, yet she’s the one being punished. Frankly, I think she acted rather bravely, and considering her very young age, is it just to put her away for 11 years? She deserves a pardon, but people like her don’t get them.

@Jontavious, sorry, but the pressure to plead guilty, even if you are innocent, is a clear contract of adhesion that would never stand up in civil cases. Personally, although I know it would put a wrench in the criminal justice system, I would not mind if plea bargaining were abolished. As things currently stand, the purpose of the criminal justice system in this country is about little more than securing an orderly conviction. Maybe that needs a wrench put in it.

Seeking out riots in other states so you can bring your AR-15 along and shoot at people is psychopathic behaviour no matter what you and @Max believe. 

In most sane nations, such behaviour is harshly punished—even if you don't fire a shot. Just the act of carrying such a gun into a crowd is seen, rightly, as dangerously antisocial.

@Max They weren't "attackers" - they went after him because he had already shot that gun, making him an active shooter in everyone's eyes.  

Add to that, he was carrying his Dad's gun illegally in Wisconson because he was underage.  

And if his Dad lived in Wisconsin, which is a big state for hunting, then no matter how dumb he was, he certainly knew he was carrying illegally.  

I never did understand why he was let off that charge, nor why all the police whom he interacted with before he fired that gun didn't ask that babyface his age.

Just reading the headline makes me cringe.  Here you have a 16 year old child with nothing but bad choices who did what she felt she needed to do to eat and to have food for her kids.  He took complete advantage of a child in a horrible situation.  

Who could tolerate that kind of situation and then be expected to act in a reasonable manner when it got intolerable?  My guess is that no one (or nearly no one) reading this article can even comprehend what her life was like.  Certainly not the judge.

The shooting of Mr. Volar would never have happened if the police and district attorney had done their job when the girl he was abusing called 911. They're the people who should serve time for letting Volar continue to traffic teenage girls. In effect, they are accessories to Volar's many crimes.

The 11 year sentence is a clear miscarriage of justice, made possible by the pervasive sexism and especially racism in the criminal justice system.

If a white male was trafficked (or simply kidnapped - which in reality is what being trafficked is, being kidnapped, but you pay your own ransom with your body!) and eventually killed their trafficker (kidnapper)...he'd be lauded and likely have gotten a powerful law firm to pro-bono represent him.

Justice was served - when she killed the guy. She should be free and in care of people to help her get her life back. 

I dont care if she planned it - and how else would she do it? - or set the guy up to take advantage of a weak moment. Once he trafficked her, he abandoned any mercy, or fair treatment. 

Of course this paragraph says it all. Perfectly examples the racism and sexism burned-in to the police and legal system. But lets be more precise Imagine if these girls were white...Imagine! 

"Imagine a Black man, aged 34. Imagine him with videos of young white boys who appear to be 12, 13, 14 years old. Imagine those videos contained footage of grown men having sex with young boys. Imagine that 20 of those videos were shot by the suspect himself. Now tell me: In what world does law enforcement let such a person go free without bail?"

Sexism and racism in law enforcement and the judicial system is not "a few bad apples," its burned-in to both.

@Max Kiser was 16 when victimized and 17 at the time of her abuser’s death. Compassion dictates a far milder sentence, in my opinion, if any at all for someone so young. And maybe jury trials should be mandatory in such cases. With a full press trial, we could have learned far more about the circumstances surrounding the tragedy, including expert witness testimony.

The amount of gloss this author put over the details of the crime could have turned a parking lot into an ice rink.

No one is denying the despicable acts of the abuser. He clearly was an awful human and should have been sentenced to many years in prison. 

What Chrystul did was equally deplorable. It was premeditated murder for the purpose of robbery. She was not killing him to escape a life of abuse, she was killing him for his BMW. It was an execution. 

Did Volar play a part in creating the monster that killed him? Yes. No matter what however, it’s still murder.

Being able to raise a defense that she was trafficked IN TRIAL, is critical. We can't just let women (or men) victims claim they were abused to justify a murder; it doesn't work that way. That is what a trial does. She murdered someone; she now has a defense to raise (per Wisconsin Supreme Court) - in trial. And the difficulty she faced with going to trial or accepting a guilty plea is a choice thousands of criminal defendants have to make throughout this country, every day. Many of those decisions are made by persons facing murder charges, and other serious crimes (sexual assault, etc.). This isn't new, and it is not evidence of a corrupt criminal justice system by any means. This young woman's story is a horrible one, but I could share many other horrible stories from other criminal defendants who I represent, every day, Black and White, male and female, as a criminal defense attorney, who also have to make difficult decisions about the uncertainty of a trial versus a plea (and looking at decades in prison, or life). The background story here is hard to read about, but the justice system she faced is not a surprise.

@Jontavious It's seriously misleading to claim that the system isn't designed to force defendants to choose a plea bargain over a trial.  The resources of the legal justice system simply can't accommodate court trials for everyone who deserves one or should have one in their own best interest.  Add to that the huge disparity of resources between the prosecution and defense teams and the relative scarcity of really good public defenders and rolling the dice becomes an even riskier choice.  One look at the prison population confirms that the system's outcomes are racist and classist.  Intersectionality is a real thing in America's courtrooms.  Until the offices of the District Attorney and the Public Defender are combined and lawyers are randomly assigned both sides of the docket with equal resources, the central thesis of this op-ed will remain true.

If the court sentenced this young woman to prison for murder, what the court is saying you can't take the law into your own hands, go to authorities. The only time you can defend yourself, is if at that moment you fear for your life, and can articulate it, and are believed based on a thorough investigation.

She is absolutely a sympathetic victim but those facts alone show she probably did commit a little murder.  If she'd called the police after shooting him, I bet she wouldn't have been convicted at all.  Maybe 11 years is too long but I don't think zero years would have been the right punishment either.

Lawyers saying "she agreed to the plea, end of story" are ignoring that this is a girl, a victim thousands of times over. This is not a predator like Donald Trump.

She, a minority on multiple fronts, had the audacity to stand up to people committing violent hate crimes against her, so she had to be punished, because that's justice in the eyes of the American legal system.

Chrystul was 16 when she met and 17 when she shot, killed and set afire a man who'd abused her, forced her to have sex with other men, and was then trying to rape her again. The setting him afire tells us the trauma she was living.

In what universe would an adult man get this kind of sentence for protecting himself, his manhood, his personhood?

Prosecutors and commenters pontificate about the need for punishment, the wrongness of "taking human life"--in effect, Chrystul's had already been taken. Consider this and sentence her to meaningful time in a program supporting young women at risk for trafficking or those ensnared.

She's a tragic victim of injustice, and he's a monster. No question. But that's not the only issue here: we have to ask, suppose she's let go for killing him because of what she said he was doing to her in that moment? Suppose, in other words, the rule against murder had exceptions for people whom the victims say, credibly, were abusing them? That would, in effect, license a death penalty for people who don't even get a trial, where no evidence is demanded. The risk of abuse would be insurmountable. True, in this case, I believe her. But we're talking about killing, about permanently ending a life, and "he said-she said" (even when we believe her!) isn't supposed to be enough for that. That kind of mob justice isn't the world we want. And for what it's worth, back when we had that kind of world -- and no due process -- it was racial minorities who suffered most. Despite this case, I'm glad it's not our world, even if the price is that good people sometimes get jailed for killing bad people.

Disgusting.  It's interesting if this story was fictional or a movie, we would all be cheering that she was able to defend herself by killing this degenerate evil man and she would get off. But in reality, she has a sentence to serve because she tried to defend herself and get out of that horrible life.  
You are completely right Professor Snyder, the justice system is completely corrupted, racist, and misogynistic not only in America but the world over.  Please read my daughter's article about a similar case of injustice in Canada to see this is a pandemic itself.

I’ve noticed a distinct lack of empathy across our society, which strikes me as the natural result of its predatory capitalist nature. 

In America as long we ignore the basic human needs for food, shelter and comprehensive care that every other civilized country ensures as an obvious way to develop and sustain the most productive and healthy society. 

In America it seems as though too many of the haves want to punish the have-nots for being poor, black, brown and/or female. They refuse to feed children lunch at school but they’ll send billions of dollars to a war zone, and lose it.

There are two sides to this story, only one is presented here.

There seems no question but that Mr. Volar was the worst sort of sexual predator, and it seems inexcusable that law enforcement did not go after him, and prosecute  him vigorously.  Ms. Kizer and many others were horribly and likely criminally abused by this man. Racism in our system of justice may have played a role in the failure to pursue Mr. Volar vigorously; frankly, it's hard to judge.

But there are also questions about what happened the night of his death at the hand of Ms. Kizer.  She traveled to his home voluntarily, and set his house on fire after killing him.

This seems not to be self defense; this seems like vigilante justice.  From what I've read Ms. Kizer was allowed to present a defense that her actions were a result of the abuse she experienced, but this defense was not sufficiently convincing to result in acquittal.

We must beware of vigilante justice, even in cases like this. The evidence that her prosecution and conviction was tainted by racism is not convincing. Rather, there is reason to believe her conviction was appropriate, though her sentence may have been too severe.

Children and women who kill their abusers are usually judged quite harshly by society and the justice system.  Men don't like the idea that an abused woman might kill her abusive husband or boyfriend when his back is turned because that's the only way left for her to get out of the relationship once he's nearly killed her.  It's fine when the man kills his wife or girlfriend claiming that she deserved it.  The reverse isn't true.  The same goes for abused children.  When they kill their abusers they are treated like adults with adult motives by the system.

What amazes me is how often the abuse is allowed to go to the point where someone is killed, that someone usually being the victim.  Abusers are rarely killed and rarely get what they deserve for killing or severely injuring another human being.  My parents abused me physically and verbally.  Because we were middle class nothing was done about it.  Because I wasn't failing in school or being disruptive no one cared.  I had learned my lessons well:  take the abuse and shut up.

As I understand things, Ms. Kizer hasn't been grateful enough or behaved the way she should have.  (This is from other sources.)  Why should she be grateful to a system that let her abuser continue or set him free to abuse her and others?  Why wasn't she believed and why weren't things done to prevent this?  She may have planned his killing but he killed something far more important:  her childhood and coming of age at her own speed.

The prosecuting agency in this case, the office of the District Attorney, presumably made the decision as to what kind of plea deal agreement was made available to this defendant.  Likely a pre-sentence investigation was conducted, and a report prepared, by the Probation Department, including a recommendation for sentencing.  And then a Judge sentenced (with or without question-I don’t know).  The writer does an excellent job of moving beyond the defendant as a victim responding to trauma and threat, to the decision making regarding sentencing.  If this were the only case in a Court in the United States wherein implicit not acknowledged racial and gender bias played a role in severity of sentencing then this would be justifiably a news breaking story,  But it is not.  One does not need to speculate how sentences for the same crime can differ based on race and gender and power. There are many, many cases wherein the exact same conviction brings a different sentence based on bias.  Mandatory bias screening and  training for every level in the criminal justice system is desperately needed.  I ask: Was she blamed for not seeking help otherwise when she knew how power works?  As in Jeffrey Epstein?

@Leslie I agree about attention being paid to Catholic priests and boys because the victims were boys. Nonetheless, ministers, priests, and other authorities are known to have sexually used and abused girls, many of them white, in their congregations and religious institutions, including girls schools. Little is discussed about this because of the peer pressure of church women over the victims. I was such a victim...6 years old.  I thought I was being holy and helping "Father."  Believe me, while many people weren't happy with the Reverend "Father," it was I who was punished. It all started with prep for First Communion. I had a bad rep in the first grade.  I don't relate to Chrystal Kizer's going online, but I know what it's like to have adults smirking at me claiming to know what I was thinking. Traditional cultures all sexualize children when those children fill someone's needs. Religious, social services, and legal systems are all controlled from the top down. Such castes cut across race.

Incarceration is a huge business in the U.S. where almost no one goes to trial. They, (well over 90%), take a plea deal rather than a life ruining trial and draconian sentence. 

It’s the justice, “system,” where incarceration and punishment is a very real job security for multiple layers of workers lawyers and judges right down to people working in the prison cafeterias. There’s an active incentive to keep prisons full and steer arrestees  to a plea so the expense of the trial is avoided. If everyone went to trial the system could never handle it.

Fun fact, police use their body cameras, not for their monitoring, but to insure plea deals on low level crimes, controlling more of the public, mostly people with very limited wealth. Defendants are told they have video of their crime and plead out. 

Also, “resisting arrest," is enhanced by the audio of the camera where police will simply say aloud, “stop resisting,” during the arrest, and a, "resisting arrest," charge is falsely implemented, and added to the charges, as leverage to plead.

@A W Well, needless to say, there was. She was charged because texts and her movements around the time of the shooting showed she travelled to his house with a gun planning to shoot him and steal his car, which she did. 

The story about shooting him in self-defense is one of several she told after being caught. 

That doesn't mean it's necessarily untrue, but there was solid evidence of a premeditated plan to kill him and steal his car, and she did indeed steal his car. This is why she was charged, and it is also why she chose to accept a plea rather than go to trial - because she and her lawyers knew that there was incriminating evidence that would have called her story into serious question.

She went to the guy's house, shot him in the head with an illegal firearm, set the place on fire, and stole his car. Come on. Yes, that guy should have been in prison. But that is straight up premediated murder with a bunch of other serious crimes stacked on top. Being the victim of a crime does not green light you to commit Hollywood-style vigilante justice.

Before I go way out onto a limb, let me first recommend the book "Who Would Believe a Prisoner," by the Indiana Women's prison History Project. The book touches on the abuses of religious institutions such as the Good Shepherd Homes.  

Billy Holiday escaped from a Good Shepherd Home in Baltimore.  Billy had been sent there because Billy's mother was a prostitute.  For a time, Billy kept herself and others clothed and fed by working as a prostitute. It has been said that prostitution is the world's oldest profession.

Girls and women being used and abused by men for sex is not a racial problem.  Girls and women being used and abused by men is a gender-based problem.   Girls and women are, for the most part, smaller and less muscular than men and so, are at a particular disadvantage in partnerships that include sexual behavior, be it marriage or prostitution.  Isn't the ostensible purpose of a pimp to protect prostitutes?  How does that work? 

"Traditional" society has encouraged some women to smile and pose and provide sex for men who might not be getting it from wives.  I am closer to the trunk of the tree when I say that some priests got their sexual needs met from unfortunate girls sent to the many schools for girls run by nuns.  Many indigenous girls report being used for sex in the residential schools to which they were sent by the government. 

Used for free or used for money?  Either way, a young girl might wish to retaliate against a trafficker.

I know a man who posted mildly pornographic beauty shots to Tumblr that were labeled as teenaged. The police guessed the ages of the girls to be 16-25. He was arrested for possession of child pornography (searching for his name will tie him to that charge).

The state did not attempt to identify the subjects. He served 2 years and will forever be tied to the worst label imaginable.

Meanwhile, I know a young woman (17, in Arkansas) who was coerced by a 19yo (in Missouri) to send a single naughty photo. He did the unthinkable the first time (and only) they went out. The photo convinced the state police that the girl was lying. She was threatened with arrest if she didn’t drop the complaint.

This op-ed is extremely misleading. 

Wisconsin Public Radio presents the events leading up to the shooting as arguably premeditated, particular given texts in advance in which the shooter stated she was going to be getting the soon-to-be decedent's car.

Killing in imminent self-defense is excusable. But planning to kill someone who did you wrong and then going through with it is legally punishable homicide.

The laws governing the use of deadly force require that there be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. You cannot avenge a past injustice. You cannot kill someone to defend property. You can't shoot someone if they attempt to flee. Without that restriction we'd have vigilante justice. I'm sympathetic to the convicted woman, but she was not acting in self-defense. A light sentence would be appropriate, I think.

@Patrick 

Under your logic, is anyone who has been wronged criminally — including countless cases far worse than this one — justified in murdering the offender?

If a drunk driver kills my entire family but I survive, can I hunt them down and murder them? What about survivors of childhood sex abuse ... can they find and murder their abusers days, weeks or months later?

The point is, murder is almost never justifiable morally or legally. However, there are mitigating circumstances in this case, such as the victim's age, that would rightly call for a reduced sentence.

It is hardly news that U.S Justice is not only blind to the supposed origins of a party, but is also largely blind to valid legal arguments.

This sentence may be invalid, but so was the gentleman who spent decades in a Mississippi Prison after being convicted of a murder in a furniture store after some 5 or more trials.   The State's District Attorney had composed juries nearly exclusively of White jurors where the man accused was African-American and multiple trials had been found defective due to the jury selection, but the offense against a jury of his peers was repetitively instituted.

Only recently, even the State prosecutors of Missouri had appealed for the release of a prisoner held for decades while the Court of Appeals delayed the release of the prisoner for no clear reason.

Justice is a concept and it is sometimes managed, but its application is often much less than one would hold as being at all reasonable and it certainly often comes well too late for the best practice otherwise imagined.

As uncomfortable as it may be, the willingness to stretch the concept of "justifiable murder" leads to far too many individuals believing they have the right to kill.  One need only look at the "stand your ground laws" to start to understand that when individuals start to take "justice" into their private hands, it undermines the ability to maintain a well-regulated society.  Could Ms. Kizer have gone to the police when Mr. Volar started abusing her? Why did she not?  Does "trauma" strip all agency from victims? 

There were not a few inconsistencies in her story and in her action (Mr. Volar attacked her, yet she was able to access her purse and find a gun a shoot him?)

Is Ms. Kizer simply a vessel onto which actions were imposed? Or did she, as a human being, make human choices and now has to deal with the consequences?

The one question I would ask everyone on this situation is, would you want your young daughter to be treated like he treated her and by the Justice system?  That would be followed by, why do you need to punish someone who was not an adult, who was in a bad situation which became hellishly worse, for trying to protect herself and get out from under the thumb of a man who made her have sex with other men so he could have money?

I have a daughter who is now in her 30s.  When she was a freshman in high school, a Senior in her vocal music class approached her at lunch.  He then stuck his hand inside her blouse and under her bra.  She, because of how we raised her, immediately stood up and said, “Who do you think you are?”*  She then walked away and went to the principal’s office to report this, while some of the other students, who watched this, also went to the office to report it.

But, here’s the rub: Her parents are college educated, upper middle class, who made sure she went to a good school and did her work in there.  What sort of parent did this child have?   

When all of that is taken into account, this is a miscarriage of Justice, plain and simple, and likely race based.

* She was a theater student, and had acted since she was two.  She didn’t hesitate to use her well projected voice in this.  It was noticed by her theater teacher that she was louder than the quarterback calling the snap count a game, without yelling.  And yes, I’m inordinately proud of what she did.

When I moved to Texas where the cops would show up after a home invasion, remove the bodies for you, and apologize about the blood you had to clean up, I knew I was not in Wisconsin anymore. Plenty of abused spouses would get probation at worst for a serial abuser in Texas and neighboring states.

Children under the age of 18 do not have the same rights as adults, yet the courts are asked to consider them as adults depending on the crime.

I guess from the framing of the question the answer is in your opinion no. If murdering the abuser was the only option to stay alive then it was self-defence, and she would have been acquitted I imagine at least that is my hope. What would have been an appropriate sentencing 0 years 6 months a year ? hmm “Police said that Kizer travelled from Milwaukee to Volar's home in Kenosha in June 2018 armed with a gun. She shot him twice in the head, set his house on fire and took his car.”  Well it was certainly premeditated, she is or was a violent individual having grown up in a violent and uncaring unloving word….so I can’t answer your question as what justice would be in this case.

This op-ed brings up some good points, but it is disingenuous and sloppy.  I suspect her attorney advised her to take the deal because she bragged about killing the man on Facebook after she did it.  And her brother wound up with the BMW.  I wish the NYT would be more careful about this sort of thing - I know this is an op-ed, but it gives an incomplete picture of the evidence.  The fact that she was trafficked should impact her sentence in any event, but if her actions showed premeditation, that's a huge factor.  I see from the comments below that many NYT readers just accept the facts as set forth in this op-ed - that's unfortunate.

Author:  Be careful how you advocate justice.  For Ms.Kizer to kill her abuser, it would be self-defense if the circumstances warranted it.  However, if she went out of her way to hunt him down and kill him at a time when he posed no threat, you are seriously wrong and your entire column is suspect.  

I totally empathize with Ms. Kizer.  We have police to arrest her abuser and he can have his fair trial in court.  You advocate a vigilante style that so many other people may view as acceptable anytime they were hurt physically or emotionally.  Caveat Emptor of what you are selling!

I understand concern re takin of life. Because this was not immediately upon her entanglement, is that why it is not considered self-defense. I guess it was never considered appropriate means to correct enslavement either, but thatis essentially the situation she was in.

Robert Dotson, shot and killed by police officers who were at the wrong house. He had opened the door while holding a pistol he was in legal possession of, as was his 2nd Amendment right.

Daniel Shaver, shot to death by police in a hotel hallway while crying and begging for his life. He was unarmed.

And then on the converse side, you have police and prosecutors charging men and women for lawfully using their firearms for the purpose of self defense as is their 2nd Amendment right.

And you can always see the racism in application of this system. 2nd Amendment groups rush to defend people like Kyle Rittenhouse. But they completely abandoned Philando Castile’s family.

They are not in a position to know their options to get away, find resources, think clearly to make a plan.

Can there not be some further nuance to this case?  Clearly she was suffering from stress related emotional disturbance, such as PTSD or crippling anxiety disorder, as a result of the abuse. In that case the defense of temporary insanity could be used and psychiatric treatment be provided. In that way society would not condone the killing of one’s accuser but could understand that this type of abuse can result in a loss of control. Comparing this case to others where a clear headed adult decided to take the law into their own hands is clearly a false equivalence.

When you think about law and justice, are you thinking of one or two ideas? Counting ideas is useful in avoiding some errors. The rulers benefit if the people are hornswoggled into conflating law and justice, the rulers even using the rhetoric of justice to bamboozle us.
The trick is done in political socialization, and rhetoric in this article shows its author has not thoroughly overcome her political socialization.
Chrystul Kizer killing Volar is plainly well within the ethically correct and appropriate force to establish justice, which I shall call 'positive action.'
It's always correct since justice is always correct.
In the legal system, justice is illegal, thus judges enforcing the rule of law desire to harm Chrystul Kizer.

Vengeance is considered to be barbaric but it is a natural reaction of people who have been wronged so badly that they must not just let it go. But in a civilized society we forego revenge to let courts of law act, instead. It prevents the anarchy that arises from revenge producing feuds. 

This teenager sought revenge and got it. But deadly force is legal only to prevent deadly attack. Do so without that clear purpose and it’s murder. She was sentenced to eleven years but she could be out and on parole much sooner. Meanwhile, she has become a very violent person who may or may not overcome the demons she has been forced to internalize, so parole is probably necessary.

1. Ms. Kizer is a victim of sex trafficking

2. Ms. Kizer is also guilty of a violent killing followed by mutiliation of the body by burning it.

Not sure the Ms. Kizer gets a personal resposibility pass for life due to #1

Well…the victim of #2 happens to be the perpetrator of #1, I think that’s very important.
I’m not shocked by the violence of the 2 bullets (it takes but a pull of the finger to accomplish that, making killing by gun relatively easy and clinical) - but I was a bit by the burning of the body. 
I’ve wondered about that. Maybe she did it in order to hide the body?
If not, even if he was already dead it seems a frighteningly aggressive act. Easy for me to talk, as I haven’t been through what she has. Still, it gives one pause.

Although the police, the prosecutor, and the judge may have followed written law in this case, the outcome for this young girl was not justice. I am reminded of the old maxim:
The Law may upset Reason; Reason may never upset the Law.

That underlying philosophy in much of American jurisprudence leads to widespread injustice for victims of abuse who respond to that abuse as Ms. Kizer did; most notably if the victim is from the "wrong" zip code (another marker for race and class).

@OneView, I agree with you about Stand Your Ground laws, but I think this is a case of justifiable homicide. This is a teenager who had spent years being abused and trafficked by a violent man. She's been beaten, threatened with death, and undoubtedly terrorized with threats of what would happen if she attempted escape. There's no doubt in my mind that she suffered from PTSD because it would be impossible to escape.

I think the justice system should be able to view these cases in context. I would never vote to convict someone like Chrystul Kizer.

@Scott Wrong- you can take, and make, Justice in your own hands, without the law.

This isn't a complicated sociopolitical nuance- the reason for such proscripted directives against vigilantism in democracies with rule of law exist for issues like usurpation of public office or ballot stuffing or public, anarchic chaos, lynchings, historical examples of malign mass vigilantism, and the political danger that represents, all existential and downstream rationales beyond a concept of Justice, proscribed by law. Here, the issues are personal.

Trigger warnin: the simple reality is that this guy deserved to be pushed off a cliff- as do so many other "pimps" working in the "sex worker" industry.

"Justice" is a platonic ideal. Justice is above and apart from the official monopolisation of a consensus of human beings, whether cult members in robes and funny hats, or secular equivalents.

Many people believe the fiction of Justice is real- as if people could be unmurdered and unraped. Justice is instead best represented by its symbolic statuary, the blinded demigod with sword in one hand and scale in the other. Immediately you recognize the problem of a sighted judiciary pretending via process to reproduce the idealistic equinamity and "blindness", and forever failing the test.

Perhaps more importantly, you might want to read more about the story before concluding it was some great injustice for her to be charged. The story presented here is extremely one-sided and completely ignores a lot of the reasons she was prosecuted (i.e. texts and her movements before the shooting certainly seemed to show premeditation, and she told very different stories to different people afterward about the alleged self-defense). The victim was a total piece of work, nobody disputes that. But the evidence seemed pretty good that she went to his house with a gun to shoot him, and then did that.

I believe what Crystul thought she was signing up for were a few “dates” on her terms in exchange for money. She was not offering herself up for indentured servitude to a man and his friends/clients to do whatever they wanted to and whit her - for as long as they wanted.

That's the exchange from power into trafficking that can occur. 

The courts and judges are behind the times, and do not understand the complexities of these “relationships” - plus, are ignorant of racial bias and misogyny within their own rulings.

Where there is racism, there is almost always misogyny. These two ugly things go hand-in-hand. Women for so long deal with financial misogyny in a world that questions not only competence, but even just your right to be in the room - from the streets to the board room to the presidency. 

We are smarter - because we have to be. We work longer, simply to keep our jobs. We make less and don't rock the boat - because we are told to be grateful for what we have. I could go on and on…

Crystul is a victim. She is a rape, crime, trafficking survivor of childhood abuse - not only by the man who was pimping her out, but also by the criminal justice system. 

When she is exonerated (& I believe she will be) I hope the many millions is a balm for healing. Though as a rape survivor myself (at 19 from a brutal attack in a college dorm in CA where I was left naked, bloodied & bruised) - nothing can ever give back all that was taken from you during sexual and physical attacks.

@Mark  Shumate. I’d say rage at what was done to her is more than ample explanation for her torching the body after she killed him.  She was so angry that just killing him wasn’t enough.  Remember this is a highly traumatized child, not an adult operating with some semblance of logic and self restraint.  

That said, this sentence is incredibly unjust and at some point we should probably thank her for getting that animal off the street.

Texts and her movements before the crime show she went to his house with a gun, planning to shoot him and steal his car, which she then did. 

The story presented here about her shooting him in self-defense while he was trying to rape her is one of several she told to different people after she was caught. That doesn't necessarily make it untrue, but there are solid reasons why she was charged here. It is not at all clear that she acted in self-defense.

As with most of these stories I get the feeling something is being left out and or exaggerated.

There's a long list of reasons why some people should be killed and a shorter list of laws of why they shouldn't, designed to discourage and punish those who do.

Using street logic she may have been justified but the courts frown on people killing each other. Imagine if everyone was killed that deserved it in some abstract way? Not many of us would be alive. It's also not easy to kill someone and get away with it; unless of course you're rich.

However, as justified as shooting and killing this pimp could be, no matter how much they deserved it, the courts should look into  it. The fact she shot and killed him and then also set him on fire makes this a special case.

If she meets all the requirements of alternative sentencing -- counseling, finish school or earn GED, get a job (with assistance in placement in job), period of a few years probation, no other criminal activity or charges while on probation, all charges dismissed after a period of probation.

We should first note that we cannot kill someone even if they’ve harmed us, except in immediate self-defense. Self-defense requires an attack on our person be in progress. It cannot be asserted when the motive involves prior harm or fear of future harm. Without knowing more about the case, I can’t say much here. Age, motive, and aggravating or mitigating circumstances are considered by the prosecutor when deciding on charges to file—degree of murder or manslaughter and so on—and by the judge at sentencing. After conviction, the court often receives a presentencing report from the probation authorities, detailing their investigation of the convicted person and, in many jurisdictions, their recommendations on sentence, security classification and mental health or drug treatment. The actions we take after a killing weigh heavily in these assessments. Setting the body afire won’t look good.

If due process is observed and guilt established beyond reasonable doubt, then prison is what we can expect if we kill someone deliberately outside self-defense. The state has a monopoly on justice, added to the social contract when police, courts and corrections departments replaced the medieval vengeance system where aggrieved victims sought justice by their own means upon perceiving they’d been wronged or getting a ruling permitting them to. Early officials investigated only crimes against the state.

People do get railroaded, sometimes racially. But I don’t know if that’s true here.

@Alex One would think the judge ought to have considered "some mittigating circumstances" in this situation, not to mention the girl was not legally an adult. 

And if she had had a better lawyer, she probably would have done a bit better. 

But no, we really don't want people taking the law into their own hands and shooting someone else "because he deserved it". That sounds a bit too much like lynching.

@Fred The day I read this verdict, I also read about four 15 and 16 year old girls who beat a sick old man to death. They didn't know him and he never touched them.

They're being tried as children and if convicted, they will be released no later than their 21st birthdays.

Why did this poor child get less consideration, I wonder.

@Sheila, he was sentenced to 6 months in jail (of which he served 3) followed by 3 years of probation. He’s also on the sex offenders register, for life. 
He also wasn’t found guilty of rape because the penetration was digital. (The California laws have since been changed to include any penetration in the definition of rape)
I agree with you though. It was not long enough.

@Jesse Baker who benefits here? I just don’t see how this sentence can help this young person deal with the trauma she has been through. Americans like to put people in jail more than help them process and recover, it seems…..not saying prisons aren’t needed, just wish there was a larger view so people get some help to.

Abused girls and women of color who are disproportionately tried and convicted of crimes against their abusers is a race and class problem.

I do think her sentence is justified. As someone who comes from the street and lived the exact situations that have been described. Trauma is real but so is choosing violence. She bought a gun and wanted to commit a violent act. She had many options available to her. She was not a captive nor was she restrained. She voluntarily returned time and again to interact with this person. Having been manipulated and hurt by the prison industrial complex and those adults affected by it I know this situation all too well. She is sadly a reflection of a violent culture and a violent person herself. The reactions seem very much based not in fact but in a desire not to have an unpopular opinion. This is what lead to the grooming gangs in the United Kingdom going unpunished to this day.

How can we change the bias inherent in our police forces?

The only way is to screen every person who wants to become a police officer. Give them personality tests, have them submit to a lie detector test, screen their social media feeds, and have a psychologist conduct a personal interview.

The time and money spent on these preventive measures will greatly enhance the credibility and trustworthiness of the police department.

The public needs to trust the police. For that to happen we need good men and women to be on the job.

@Tom Walker. The only way to accomplish that is for the civilian public to have power over the police.   End the unions, remove internal affairs, explicitly require them to protect people in danger,  require liability insurance, and most importantly take hiring and discipline away from the force and put it in civilian hands exclusively.

Law is created and administered by humans-- predominantly male, white humans. It would almost be odd if it did not have a bias in that direction. 

Confusing law with justice is a category error- as the philosophers of language would say.

@Somethingtosay  One is, indeed, psychotic when so desperate to end abuse that killing is the only option..... Ms Kizer is not the only one....but probably the only woman to be jailed for ending the horror she endured.   She was "killed" every time she was raped.  Yes, rape is a death sentence that robs every victim of her dignity, personhood, and future.

This is a tough one. On one hand, this guy got what he deserved. On the other, you can’t take the law into your own hands. A sentence of this length does seem harsh considering the victim was a child at the time. One hopes that she only serves a small portion of that sentence and while in custody, she gets every access for counseling, education, training, and support.

She should have received therapy, access to education, and support. She was a minor at the time, a victim who acted out of desperation in self defense. 

I get why she took the plea deal, but this never even should have been charged at all. It's a clear example of prosecutorial overreach.

Because men commit most of America's nonviolent and violent crimes, something like 9 to 1.

Insult to injury, women taxpayers have to fund the vast law enforcement and criminal justice system that does little to protect them.

Basically, men are not cost-effective.

@Dg Rittenhouse was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, this woman was not. It's that simple. Her abuse may have been a mitigating circumstance in regards to sentencing but it was not self-defense, which is a defense against the charges themselves.
