        <h1>Chrystul Kizer's Case: A Reflection of Systemic Racism and Sexism</h1>
        <p>In 2018, a Black teenager named Chrystul Kizer shot and killed a 34-year-old white man named Randall Volar III, who had sexually abused and trafficked her starting when she was 16 years old; she was 17 at the time of the killing. This week, a Wisconsin judge sentenced her to 11 years in prison, with another five under supervision. Rather than serving justice, her case illustrates with searing clarity the sexism and racism that corrupt our criminal justice system.</p>
        <h2>Chrystul Kizer's Story</h2>
        <p>In a 2019 investigation, The Washington Post detailed Ms. Kizer’s life: Her single mother, who struggled to support her four children. The abusive man and the family’s time in a homeless shelter. Ms. Kizer wanted money for snacks and school notebooks, so she placed an ad in an online forum called backpage.com, which was notorious for sex trafficking (it has since been shut down). Mr. Volar was the first one who answered. He showered her with gifts and took her to fancy dinners; she understood there was a price to these extravagances. But before long, she said he was taking her to hotels to have sex with other men. He’d wait outside for her and insist she turn the money over to him. He called himself an “escort trainer.” One night, when he wanted to have sex and she brushed him off, she said she fell to the ground and he jumped on top of her, trying to force off her clothes. She shot him twice in the head, and then, the police said, set his body on fire.</p>
        <h2>The Systemic Failure</h2>
        <p>Ms. Kizer’s case has been in the national spotlight since she killed Mr. Volar; a petition to drop her charges garnered more than a million and a half signatures. In what was a major win for her side, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that she could argue that her crime was justified because she was trafficked by Mr. Volar — a groundbreaking ruling for trafficking victims. In order to make that argument, however, she would have to take her chances on a long, difficult, very public trial. Or she could take a plea deal.</p>
        <p>Four months before his death, Mr. Volar had been arrested after another young girl called 911 claiming he’d drugged her and was threatening to kill her. The police searched his home and found hundreds of videos of sexual abuse. He had a penchant for Black girls, like Ms. Kizer: hers was among those young faces found in the videos. Mr. Volar was released without bail the same day, pending an investigation. The police saw girls in the videos that looked as young as 12 and 13, and yet, “In many and most of the cases, we didn’t know the age,” prosecutor Michael Graveley told The Post. “So we literally did not know whether we had misdemeanors or felony.”</p>
        <p class="quote">“In this world, the one we’ve created, courts and prosecutors have long claimed that young girls seduce men, or consent to abuse, or, have ulterior motives, such as, in Ms. Kizer’s case, killing an unsuspecting man for his fancy car. In this world, Black girls, especially, are routinely over-sexualized by law enforcement and the judiciary: The lead investigator in the case against Mr. Volar wrote of one of Mr. Valor’s victims that she was “prostituting herself out.” He was writing about a 15-year-old.</p>
        <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
        <p>Beth Richie, author of the classic book, “Compelled to Crime: the Gender Entrapment of Battered Black Women,” told me that racist stereotypes enable court systems to filter out all understanding that a Black woman “could possibly have been a victim of horrendous abuse. She presents as a violent Black woman, not a survivor of gender-based violence.”</p>
        <p>Ms. Kizer’s case is not unique. Cyntoia Brown, another young Black woman who made national news, spent 15 years in a Tennessee prison after she killed a man who’d trafficked her when she was 16. Tammy Johnson, also Black, was trafficked starting at age 14 by a boyfriend who later became her pimp. She had to “earn” his love by sleeping with other men and bringing in the money. If she refused, she was beaten with a baseball bat, or a belt buckle or the heel of a shoe. Eventually, another pimp killed one of her clients, and she drove the getaway car. She was convicted and sentenced to life without parole. She served 28 years before her sentence was commuted. Ms. Brown and Ms. Johnson were eventually freed, their sentences finally recognized as egregious injustices. But countless others whose stories we don’t know still languish in prison cells across the U.S.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kizer was trying, in the best way she knew, to help her family: She posted the ad on backpage.com so she could buy food and school supplies. Ms. Kizer didn’t know that under federal law, it is illegal to solicit someone under the age of 18 for prostitution. What she did know were the layers of systemic racism embedded into her life: poverty, homelessness, abuse, hunger.</p>
        <p>After the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling, she had a choice. She could go to trial and risk getting a life sentence — her life for his, if you didn’t count how he’d already hijacked hers — or take a plea deal and some lesser time to serve. She faced up to 30 years on the plea. But 30 years wasn’t life, at least. She took the plea.</p>
        <p>She could have risked a trial, of course. But consider what the world had taught her by then, a poor Black girl with men’s violence and control all around her, with a law-enforcement system that prioritized her abuser’s freedom at the cost of her trauma, a world that said sometimes you were hungry and sometimes you needed school supplies, but no good comes from wanting. For six years her case was in and out of court, all the way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and what did that get her? An impossible gamble. What were the odds she’d prevail, in this world we’ve made for her?</p>
